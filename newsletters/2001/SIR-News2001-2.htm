<br>
<p><font size=3 color=black>
On Saturday, March 30th, 30 riders met for the annual SIR Spring 100 km Populaire.  
Again this year, we ended the 
ride at the Redhook Ale Brewery in Redmond with burgers and beer.  Pins were handed out to 
each particiapant.<br><br>  
Although the route was the same as last year, we did have the unexpectant 
ride up and down Snoqualmie Falls without any traffic.  The road was closed to motor vehicles
following the damage caused by the earthquake.

Millersylvania Ride Report<br>
<font size=4>by <a href="mailto:gr8tandem@home.com">Greg Sneed</a><br><br>
  
<font size=3 color=navy>
Gad, Lovey and I needed you folks up front on Saturday. It was like kids getting let 
out of school for the summer. Everybody was in the mood to rock. Big Chainrings were 
the order of the day.<br><br> 

With overcast and mid 40's weather, I think everybody had forgotten what it's like to 
have low traffic and long open roads.<br><br> 

On the rollies flat heading south the big tandem teams powered the Peleton. Jeff & 
Louise Davis (Awesome Team), Kristie & Peter Rankin (Looking good on thier Tricked out 
tandem), Max Maxon & Linda Knapp-1 (Napsters will be strong this year) and Lovey-2 and 
Greg-4 (Need a number of new parts, Yea and the tandem needs work too). Held 20 mph for 
the first hour until reaching the hills.<br><br> 

On the climbs, the old pros were up front lead by Ron Himshoot-5 (Still the best) , Mike 
Merritt (Great to have the Old Pro back with the lead group), Terry Oldmsted (Fits with 
the AARP Team like a glove). Right behind were the new kids Sue Cady (Rode like a warrior, 
tough day for the smaller riders with no weight), Rami Hadad (Climbs with the best), and
Duane Wright -5 who had arrived late (big surprise).<br><br>

With 85 miles now complete, we're at 1/3 the Fleche distance and folks are pumped. With 
seven new riders this (a record), Lovey and I are amazed the way these folks are 
pitching.<br><br> 

p.s. A big Thank You to <a href="mailto:cedarrvr@aol.com">Bill & Melody</a> from Olympia 
Wheelman for putting on such a great event. Lovey and I were sore all day 
Sunday.

Why I Ride<br>
<font size=4>by Peter McKay</a><br><br>

<font size=3 color=navy>
On Saturday, March 24th, six riders left Greg Cox's home to pre-ride the 200 km: Greg Cox, 
Ed Dreyer (friend of Greg's from Boeing), Bill Dussler, Anne Marie McSweeney, Mark Thomas and 
I.  Six riders is a lot for a pre-ride.   But, several of us need the extra training, 
or are unavailable for the ride next weekend.<br><br>
<img align=right border=0 width=300 height=190 src="Bill-Ed.gif">

This year's 200 km is essentially the same as last year's with two changes.  Rather than ride 
the Soos Creek Trail near the beginning and end, we ride surface streets to the west.  Greg 
also found a nice alternative road south of the King County fairgrounds.
<br><br>

I made early reservations with Mary to spend the night at Greg's house.  It paid off as I got
the spare bedroom.  I'm suffering from a sinus infection (and a cyst in my ear canal, I later 
learn) and feel miserable.  When I 
awoke, I lay there with my left side of my head throbbing in pain.  I don't feel like riding 
this morning.  As I dress, each time I move my head sharply, a pain shoots through it.  This 
is not fun.<br><br>


It's now 6:00 and we're off.  It feels good to be back on my bicycle.<br><br>

<img align=left border=0 width=180 height=250 src="Greg.gif">
Much of the ride is an exercise in pain and nasal fluid management.  For pain, I try ibuprofen.  
It helps a little, but not enough.  Also, I place cotton in my ears to keep out the cold.  
It too helps some.  Riding in the cool temperatures 
has always given my nose an excuse to run.  Today, it is working with extra vigor.  <br><br>

<u>Loose screw #1</u> Between Hobart and Enumclaw, Mark stops to replace the bolt securring his 
front fender.  As we ride off, I notice his left bike rack bolt is coming out -- tragedy
averted.<br><br>

Later on, I cannot keep up with Greg, Bill, Ed and Mark.  Anne Marie and I 
hang back, sharing pulls.  In Enumclaw, we inadvertently passed the rabbits at a water stop. 
Mark catches us and pulls us, eventually all the way to the base of the climb into Eatonville.
<br><br>

<u>Loose screw #2</u> While on our way to Electron, I notice Mark's tail light is loose.  
We stop.  He touches it and it falls into his hands.  It broke exactly as Wayne had predicted!
We ride on.<br><br>

In Eatonville (photos), we 
ate heartily.  Mark dispensed his bicycling philosophy to Ed, 
"I like to eat, therefore I ride."  Mark, Anne Marie and I leave Eatonville early.  It's not 
too long before the rabbits catch us.   Mark has been wanting to pick up the pace and finds a 
willing partner in Ed.  They're Gone! <i>Like a steam locomotive rolling down the 
tracks. . .</i>
Greg flats and Bill hangs back with him.  On the next couple descends, Anne Marie and I 
spread out.  Gravity is helping to propel me.  As we approach South Prarie, she catches me and 
we ride together to reach the drive in at Buckley.<br><br>

<img align=right border=0 width=180 height=250 src="AnneMarie.gif">
<u>Loose screw #3</u> We leave the drive-in and 
descend 410.  As we begin to climb out of the river valley, each 
rider passing me tells me something is rubbing on my bike.  I stop and examine it.  My
rear brake has come loose.  I lost the nut holding the brake in place.  I'm staring at it in 
shock.  I know I do not have any replacement parts.  Bill calmly tells me, "You'll have to ride 
without it."<br><br>

Without it?  Childhood memories return.  I recall riding down a big hill near our house on my 
first bike 
with brake levers.  I stopped myself with the front brakes, flipped over the bike and crashed.  
It was a painful experience, but taught me to lead my braking from the rear.  Now, all I can 
think of is that big descent down to the Green River Valley.  Usually, it's a fun ride.
Today, I'm going to need to be extra cautious.  <i>Yea, right!</i><br><br>

I flip the brake up and hang it under the rails on my Brooks saddle.  I'm riding again and 
feeling more energetic than I was a short time ago.  Mark comments something like 
"It's a good day for a shakedown ride."<br><br>

I take the Green River Valley descent at 72.4 kph before I begin to brake.  Easing in my left 
brake to slow my 
speed I reach the stop sign, roll through it turning right.  The bottom section is less steep
and I'm at the bottom.  All the big descents are finished.<br><br>

Slowly, I manage the big climb out of the valley.  For a while, I'm on my own.  Later, Bill 
catches up after his break at the top of the climb.  He pulls me the rest of the way.<br><br>

I'm glad I rode today.  I enjoy the company of my friends.  I enjoy riding my bicycle, 
listening to the sound of spinning wheels.  I enjoy the long stretches where none of 
us talk, but to hear the sound of each other's bicycle.  I enjoy the camaraderie.  It is the
best!<br><br>

If I can get healthy, I'll be back for the 
<A href="http://www.geocities.com/Pipeline/5293/200 km2001.htm">200 km brevet</A> 
next Saturday.  The ride begins at 7 at the community park on 144th Ave. SE. 
Plan on arriving by 6:30 to register and ready your bicycle.  Remember to tighten all bolts, 
nuts, etc.<br></p>

200 km Ride Report<br>
<font size=4>by Kent Peterson</a><br><br>

<font size=3 color=navy>
It was a dark and stormy night...no wait, that's another story. It was
actually kind of drizzling at 4:30 AM on Saturday March 31st, 2001. Mark
Thomas had been very rugged and manly and had ridden down from Redmond to my
house in Issaquah. Andy Fuller had said he was riding down as well but he
wasn't there and it was time to go. Mark and I rode off into the drizzle and
headed down the Issaquah-Hobart Road toward Kent, Washington and the start
of the SIR 200 km.<br><br>

Shortly before Hobart, Mark's main headlight went out. Like the seasoned
randonneur that he is, he immediately switched on his helmet light (all true
randonneurs know the value of redundant lighting systems) but when we got to
the store at Hobart, we pulled over so he could change the bulb in his
light. Of course the store was still closed but the overhanging eves made
for a dry place to work. The rain had increased from a drizzle to a serious
rain. While Mark ransacked his bag and fiddled with his light, I munched a
candy bar from my stash of food. In a few minutes, we turned back onto the
road and saw a couple of lights coming up behind us.<br><br>

The lights belonged to Andy Fuller and Derek Bentley. They'd made it to my
house about eight minutes after we'd left and had been hoping they'd catch
up with us. I was actually the only one of the crew who was reasonably
confident I could find my way to Greg's house and the start of the ride so
we stuck together for the rest of the ride. We turned onto the Kent-Kangley
Road at Ravensdale and it was nice and light by the time we got to Lake
Meridian Park. It was till raining, but the light made things seem better.
We followed the tail-end of the 200 km course up to Greg's.<br><br>

Considering the weather was less than ideal, we had quite a crowd of people
there for the ride. I think the grand total was around 30. I was nicely
pre-soaked including my gloves which were proving to be grossly
under-performing. Pete Liekkio had the great combination of spare wool
liners, spare shell lobster mitts and a kind nature. The loan of his gloves
definitely made this ride more comfortable for me. My soaking poly-lined
gloves spent the rest of the day semi-drying in Pete's bus.<br><br>

After some chat's about fixed gear riding last year, Pete Bajema had been
interested enough to set up a fixie of his own. While I'd ridden all of last
year's brevets on the fixed, this year I'm planning on going to LEL and out
to Boston to do BMB again, so I'm riding my (relatively) new Bike Friday,
Captain America. But Pete was there at the start carrying on the fixed
tradition. Ken Krichman and Jim Giles were representing the recumbent world
on their Gold Rushes. And Terry Z and Anne Marie were there with their
tandem. I think the rest of the folks were on fairly conventional bikes of
various types of steel, titanium and carbon fiber. Most folks had fenders
and those without were suitably hassled about it.<br><br>

We rolled out at 7:00 AM. The first thing I noticed was "man, we've got some
fast folks here!". The pace was zippy. There was a little navigationally
induced hesitancy until we got onto the road to Black Diamond but then the
lead crew kicked in the after-burners. I wasn't too far back when we rolled
into the bakery but I simply had to pause for a latte. I drank down part of
it, tossed the rest into my water-bottle and headed up to Hobart. Since the
Hobart spur is a little out and back run, I got to see the fast folks coming
back from Hobart while I was still riding toward the control. At the Hobart
store I quickly got my card stamped and rolled back out just as Ron and
Lynne were rolling in. I talked a bit with Jon Muellner, a friend of mine
who is fairly new to randonneuring. "It's going pretty good," he commented.
"Yeah," I replied, "that's usually what I'm thinking right before it all
goes hideously wrong!" Jon laughed, assuming I was joking. The line between
humor and sage advice is sometimes very fine!<br><br>

Before we get back to Ravensdale, we catch and pass Ken Krichman and then
Jon blasts on ahead. A bit after the turn onto the Cumberland Road there's
the secret control. It was still raining, so nobody lingered. As I rolled on
toward Enumclaw, Derek pulled up along side me. "I like the pace you set,"
he commented, "that Andy, he's just too fast!" Actually, on a lot of days
Derek could drop me in a heartbeat but I think he's learning the value of
pacing. I was just doing my standard pace -- fast enough that I don't
freeze, slow enough that I can go forever as long as I have food. It works
out to a randon pace of about 22 kph. If all went according to plan, I'd be
back at Greg's by 5:00 PM. Unless, of course, something goes hideously
wrong.<br><br>

Derek and I stopped at the Fairgrounds control in Enumclaw, filled our water
bottles, munched a bit and roll out. Before we'd left the control, Ron and
Lynne delivered the news that Ken Krichman missed the turn onto Cumberland
Road. Knowing Ken, this really isn't too surprising but we figured that
Ken's a trooper and he'll show up eventually.<br><br>

Derek sticks close to me on Mud Mountain Road, onto 410 and into Buckley.
From Buckley onward, the course is basically identical to last year's 200 km
and I'd ridden these roads several times since then. I did notice that the
sign to Electron was missing. Later, I found out that that missing cue did
confuse a few people. I mention to Derek that we're in prime Bigfoot
sighting country, but there weren't too many animals of any sort out and
about. The weather was still less than perfect. The rain would stop for a
while but then it would decide to start up again, sometimes strong and
sometimes just misting. The wonderful views of Mount Rainier never
materialized. <br><br>

Before Kapowsin we pass the tandem. Terry and Anne Marie are fixing a flat
but assure us that they have all they need. At Kapowsin we stopped for a big
snack. I bought a pint of milk, a Frappicino, a ham/turkey/cheese sandwich,
and a king-sized Mounds bar. I also refilled one of my bottles with juice.
While we were stopped, Terry and Anne Marie passed us.<br><br>

We rolled on toward Eatonville and again went through a patch of heavy rain.
We were still on the Orville Road, just a bit before the turn onto SR-161
when we saw the first riders coming back. This confused Derek for a bit
until I explained that the course is basically an out and back from Buckley
to Eatonville. I also pointed out that since we'd had the runs out to Black
Diamond and Hobart at the start, we were well past the halfway point now. We
just had to do that little climb up to Eatonville.<br><br>

I had a Garmin Etrex summit tucked into my Camelbak and on the post-mortem
dump of the ride the chart of that little climb looks like a cardiac spike
on an EEG. The redeeming features of the climb are the bakery at the top and
the fact that we get to go down that same hill. I bought a cookie at the
bakery although I was still stuffed from the Kapowsin snack. As we were
pulling out, I saw Dick Pado pulling in.<br><br>

On the descent out of Eatonville, Derek got frisky and pulled ahead. I
yelled out, "Don't miss the turn" as he came around me, but I don't think he
heard me. Orville Road turned off to the right and Derek went straight. I
shook my head, hoped he'd figure it out soon and turned onto the Orville
Road.<br><br>

I kept looking back, but I never saw Derek. I did see other riders, however.
I was guessing that about half the field was in front of me and half behind
and that seemed to be the way things were working out. I saw Ken Krichman so
I knew he'd made it back on course. Jim Giles was looking happy and Max and
Ron Himschoot were riding strong. I saw quite a few others as well and then
I saw Jon Muellner. Hmm, Jon was supposed to be way ahead of me. Something
must've gone hideously wrong!<br><br>

Past the Kapowsin store I saw Duane Wright. I think he was the last rider at
that point. As he wrote me later: "On the morning of the SIR 200 km I woke up
thinking I was Kent Peterson ...so I biked to the start. Shortly into the
actually 200 km ... I realized that I was *not* Kent Peterson but actually
Duane Wright."<br><br>

At that particular moment, I think the course was busy explaining to
everybody exactly who they were and what they'd have to do to get home. And
it all came down to keeping the pedals turning.<br><br>

It was a pretty fast run back to SR-162. The weather improved and there was
a nice tailwind. I stopped at the control in South Prairie, slammed down
another pint of milk and refilled one of my water bottles with juice. I was
just about ready to head out when Derek pulled in. I waited around a bit and
we took off together. Derek kept quizzing me about where we were and when I
figured we'd be back. My best guess was still putting us back at Greg's
between 4:30 and 5:00 PM.<br><br>

After Buckley and the bit on 410, we turned onto 244th in Enumclaw and the
tailwind really kicked in. We hummed along and blasted down the hill into
the Green River Gorge. The climb out was considerably more sedate. I dropped
down to the granny and twiddled my way up. On the Kent-Black Diamond Road
the wind was a quartering headwind but we didn't care, we were almost done
and the sun was finally shining. The sky was even showing blue in a few
places.<br><br>

We got in at 4:26 PM. I told Derek, "well, we're not done yet, we've still
got to ride home."<br><br>

"No," he replied, "I think Andy's going to catch a ride home with somebody."<br><br>

"Well," I said, "that's just the kind of weenie behavior I want to be a part
of!"<br><br>

Greg Cox and family put on a fine post-ride feed and after we'd eaten and
swapped our stories, Pete Liekkio 
gave a bunch of us a ride home in his giant bus.<br><br>

And since I was lugging these little bits of technology around here are some
stats:<br><br>

Distance: 212.93 km<br>
Rolling Ave: 24.7 kph<br>
Bike Time: 8:35:16<br>
Total Time: 9:26<br>
Rando Pace 22.6 kph<br>
Max speed: 61 kph<br>
Temp 45-55 degrees F<br>
Rain you betcha!<br>
Total Ascent 1702 meters<br>
Total Descent 1644 meters (since we began and ended at the same place, I'm
figuring we had a bit of atmospheric pressure change)<br>
Max Elev 263 meters<br>
Min Elev 44 meters<br>

Below is a message from <a href="mailto:bernie@powerhouse64.freeserve.co.uk">
Bernard Mawson</a>, an article and press release regarding the foot and mouth 
disease/epidemic in the UK.<br><br>

The L.E.L. will not be cancelled because of Foot & Mouth, if any problems do
arise the route will be diverted to bypass any problem areas.<br><br>

<b>MAFF tells cyclists they can ride</b><br><br>

CTC, the national cyclists' organisation, and the Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) 
have told cyclists they can cycle on roads throughout the UK, during the foot 
and mouth outbreak.<br><br>

CTC has produced a set of guidelines which MAFF has approved, encouraging cyclists to
support the tourist industry and rural communities. MAFF says road cycling does not
contravene measures to halt the spread of the disease.<br><br>

Cyclists, particularly those in contact with livestock, must still abide by restrictions
imposed by MAFF and local authorities and avoid rights of way that have been closed. But
cyclists may still use the roads network and should continue with their plans for weekend
and Easter breaks.<br><br>

CTC Director Kevin Mayne said: "Every cyclist can take these guidelines with
them when they ride with the approval of the government. We have given cyclists and
the cycle industry everything needed to get you back on the road."<br><br>

For more details contact Kevin Mayne on 07771 895533 or CTC Media Officer
Cath Harris on 07909 685600.<br><br>


<b>CTC/MAFF Guidelines for Cyclists<br>

Foot and Mouth Disease Precautions</b><br>

Issued on Friday 16th March 2001.<br><br>

CTC is encouraging cyclists to play their part in keeping the rural economy and
countryside tourism alive by continuing to use the minor roads network, not to stop riding
or cancel planned Easter trips by operating within guidelines agreed with MAFF.<br><br>

To quote Nick Brown, Minister for Agriculture "The public should stay away from farms and
livestock. This does not mean that people should not visit market towns, go to events
taking place in villages or admire the landscape"<br><br>

The Guidelines are:<br><br>

1. The risks of transmission of Foot and Mouth Disease by cyclists are no
different to any other user of the countryside.<br><br>

2. There is no reason to restrict the movement of cyclists on road.<br><br>

3. Countryside users should not enter premises or areas formally restricted by MAFF or
local authorities, including closed sections of the rights of way network. All offroad
events are cancelled or postponed until further notice. Avoid all areas where there are or
may be livestock, including car parks, headquarters, venues and other areas that are
offroad or on agricultural land. Do not enter such areas even on a casual basis i.e. for
breaks or picnics.<br><br>

4. Cyclists who have contact with livestock should stick to the MAFF guidelines.<br><br>

5. We encourage cyclists to behave with sensitivity to local feelings, to avoid
confrontational behaviour and avoid congregating in large groups. Respect the wishes of
landowners who may also want to restrict access to their properties.<br><br>

Message from <a href="mailto:dgoody@mindspring.com">Diane L. Goodwin</a><br><br>

Karl Dittebrandt, fellow randonneur and brevet enthusiast, asked me
to forward the application forms and brochures of several 2001 Union
Des Audax Francais rides. He plans to participate in each and wants
to share this information with the Brevet Admins, their local clubs,
and brevet participants. He is a Union Des Audax Francais
representative in the US.<br><br>

The rides are Paris-Brest-Paris (1200 km) and Bordeaux-Paris (600 km).
Paris-Brest-Paris Audax 2001 can be found online in English format
at: <A href="http://http://perso.wanadoo.fr/audax/brest_engl.htm">
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/audax/brest_engl.htm</A>. The first session
departs on July 23rd, returning July 27th. The second session departs
on August 20th, and returns August 24th.<br><br>

The Bordeaux-Paris departs on June 23rd and returns June 24th.
Time is critical to register for these rides, Karl is anxious to help
anyone who is interested. To reach Karl, you may email him through my
email address <a href="mailto:dgoody@mindspring.com">dgoody@mindspring.com</a>.  
His telephone is 212-925-9854.
His mailing address is: Karl Dittebrandt, 87 Rivington, #6, New York,
New York 10002. I don't send "surprise" attachments - so, additional
information can be obtained by Karl or myself.<br><br>

On another note, if anyone is planning a trip to the New York City
and Jersey area, Karl has planned Audax-style rides (200 km +) and
welcomes everyone. My website <A href="http://www.dianegoodwin.com">
www.dianegoodwin.com</A> will be posting
these rides - and others.<br><br>

Thank you for your time - have a safe brevet series.
Diane L. Goodwin for Karl Dittebrandt.<br><br>
