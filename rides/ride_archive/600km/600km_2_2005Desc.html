<p><b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b></p>

<p>You don't have to be a SIR
member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are
only $10.00 to join SIR as an email-notice-only member, or $15.00 to
join SIR as a U.S.P.S. mail-notice member. Also, all SIR members must
join <a href="http://www.rusa.org/">Randonneurs USA (RUSA)</a> to
ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.</p>

<p><b>Equipment needed:</b>
Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes,
and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a
href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders
Expectations</a>. Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards
to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are
required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These
may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function.
Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be
operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are
permitted, but note that these may bother other riders</p>

<p>Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and
1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards
are recommended for group riding. Helmets are required on all SIR
events.</p>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Overnight Control:</B> Arrowhead Lodge B&B, 130 Twin Lakes Rd, Winthrop. Tel 509.996.3326. There will enough sleeping space for everyone, although late arrivals may be on air mattresses. I'll have vegetarian chili / sandwich fixings available, and there will be coffee, oatmeal, or pancakes in the morning.
</P>


<p><b>Bag Drop:</b> There will be a bag drop service for 1 bag / rider to the overnight stop.</p>

<P><B>Supplemental support:</B> SIR manned stops will be available at these locations with water and snacks:<BR>
- Rainy Pass (outbound)<BR>
- Loup Loup pass (on return from Okanogan)<BR>
- westbound descent from Rainy Pass</p>

<p>There will be water available by the barrier at the turnoff to Lone Fir campground on the ascent of Washington Pass.</p>

<p><B>Note to riders intending to ride straight through without sleeping in Winthrop: </B> Stores in the control at Marblemount are open 0500 - 2300 on weekends. Informational controls will be available for riders passing through outside of those times. Please notify the organizer as soon as possible so that support can be arranged on the descent from Rainy Pass. Riders should make sure to carry adequate water and food to compensate for lack of services when the stores are closed.</p>

<p><b>Ride Beginning:</b> Arlington Motor Inn, Arlington, WA</p>

<p><b>Ride End:</b> Arlington Motor Inn, Arlington, WA. SIR will have a room
available at the Arlington Motor Inn for showers or napping.
</p>

<p><b>Route Description:</b>
This is an out-and-back route through the fall colors in the North Cascades from Arlington to Okanogan and return. The brevet will travel roads familiar to most SIR randonneurs and Cascade 1200 anciens. From Arlington, follow SR530 east to
Darrington, then north to Rockport. Turn east on SR20 to Marblemount, Newhalem, Rainy and Washington passes to Mazama and Winthrop. Continue east towards Twisp and remain on SR20 over Loup Loup pass to the turnaround control at Okanogan. Return on SR20 over Loup Loup to Twisp and the overnight control at Winthrop. The next day will see riders return on SR20 through the North Cascades to Rockport, where we return to Arlington on SR530.</p>

<P>
<I>Construction:</I><BR>
There were three areas of minor construction when I drove through on 9/10:</p>

<P>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
<LI> Arlington Heights Rd (5 miles from start / finish). Some work is being done at the intersection of SR530 and Arlington Heights Rd. The road is fine, but the shoulder is very rough or absent in this area. The area is well marked with traffic barrels, and riders should exercise caution especially on the return leg.</LI>

<LI> SR 530 There are some sections of SR 530 between Arlington and Darrington that are being prepared for paving. When I passed through there on 9/10, there were a total of 6 sections that had grooved pavement - most sections were 20 yards or less, and one section was 0.4 mi. The road surface was rough in these areas, but there were no gravel sections. This should be no problem on Saturday morning, but riders should exercise caution on the return leg.</LI>

<LI> SR 20 A culvert is being replaced on SR 20 between Mazama and Winthrop. For this 5.5 mile stretch, traffic is being detoured onto Lost River Rd / Goat Creek Rd. This only increases the route by a couple tenths of a mile.</OL>
</P>
