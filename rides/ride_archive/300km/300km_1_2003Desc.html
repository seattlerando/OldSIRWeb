<b>Reminder:</b> All riders are reminded that any failure to conduct the ride in accordance with <a href="../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Rider Expectations</a>, <a href="http://www.rusa.org/brvreg.html" target="_blank">RUSA rules</a>, applicable laws, or any special instructions or equipment requirements for this ride may result in a time penalty or disqualification.</p>

<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b> Get to the ferry landing in Mukilteo in time for the 6:00am ferry departure.  The actual starting location will be the Clinton Ferry landing at the base of the hill.
<p>
<b> Equipment needed:</b> Most all riders will be finishing in the dark, so bring enough lighting for the front and rear to be seen from both directions.  All riders should be familiar with the SIR Brevet Riders Expectations - see <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">http://www.seattlerandonneur.org/member/SIR_rider_expectations.html</a>
<p>
Carry extra tire & tubes in case of multiple flats or slashes to the tires from glass & debris. Carry plenty of winter clothing; Lake Cavanaugh will be cold and after sunset, it will be colder (a balaclava is worth its weight in gold). Bring pocket food to overcome bonking; this is the earliest 300k in the northern latitudes, endurance training has been minimal and colder weather requires the body to burn more calories.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. Make sure lights (front / back) are in good working order.
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding. Fenders are not required, but to keep on the good side of fellow riders and minimize road spray, they are highly advisable to have.

Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>

<b>Route Description:</b> This route was last used in 2000 and has included snow flurries up at the highest point at Lake Cavanaugh, so be prepared for cold weather. The route goes up the main highway on Whidbey Island, turns eastward on highway 20 and then Northbound up Chuckanut Drive.  It then turns onto Lake Samish Road heading Southbound until Mt Vernon. Then it goes Eastbound again over the ridge crossing highway 9 and up to Lake Cavanaugh, the turn around point. Then Southbound on highway 9 to Arlington, out Jordan road to Granite Falls and then to Marysville from highway 92 and the back highway to Everett.  Then down Mukilteo Blvd and descend into Mukilteo Ferry landing to Cheers Bar. Modifications to the 2000 route have been made for 2003.
