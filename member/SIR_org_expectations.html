<blockquote>
SIR brevet organizers are expected to be familiar with the RUSA Rules for Organizers (<a href="http://www.rusa.org/orgreg.html" target="_blank">http://www.rusa.org/orgreg.html</a>). A brevet organizer is expected to take the task seriously and to look out at all times for the best interests of SIR and its members. The organizer is expected to work closely with the RBA, other SIR officials, and the SIR Board in the organization and administration of a brevet.

<p>
<a name="Planning"></a><b>Planning a Brevet Route</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
For a scheduled ride, submit a general ride description to the SIR Board for approval at least three months prior to the scheduled date. Generally the dates for brevets are set in September the previous year and submitted to RUSA/ACP.
<p>
Six weeks prior to the ride, submit a draft route description and draft route sheet to the RBA so that he or she can check it for mistakes, ambiguity, and appropriateness as an SIR brevet. The RBA must approve the ride before it is published in the SIR newsletter and/or website.
<p>
SIR has an archive of previously used routes <A HREF="../rides/route_archive.html">here</a>. Organizers who wish to create new routes should familiarize themselves with the requirements for route creation and work with the RBA to design the route. Routes may not use the same stretch of road more than once in the same direction (out-and-backs are fine). Routes need to be designed so that if a rider takes the shortest possible routes between all controls (regular or secret), the ride still meets the minimum distance. Routes should not be too far over the brevet distance (less than 5% over if possible).
<p>
The route should start and finish at the same location, which should be chosen to provide sufficient parking and easy access for the riders. Start location should have bathrooms if possible. If not, organizer should know locations of nearby facilities.
<p>
Control points should be spread as evenly as possible between the start and finish of the route. Controls should be no more than 150 km apart if possible. Controls should be manned by SIR personnel or located where one or more establishments are open for business during the time that the control is open. Control opening and closing times should be calculated using the calculator on the RUSA website at <a href="http://www.rusa.org/octime.html" target="_blank">http://www.rusa.org/octime.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Sheets"></a><b>Route Sheets</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Route sheets are recommended to be in the following format for rider convenience: 
<p>
Column 1: The total mileage.<br>
Column 2: The leg mileage. This is the distance from the location on previous line to the location on this line. <br>
Column 3: The location and turn instruction. Also denote controls with "CONTROL" and use bold font. Include the opening and closing times for each control.<br>
Column 4: Total kilometer distance. 1.609 times column 1. <br>
Column 5: The leg distance in kilometers. (This column is optional.) 
<p>
Organize route sheet layout so you can fold into a "zip-lock" plastic bag and see all the turns to the next control. The rider can refold at each control to see the turns to the next control. 
<p>
Accuracy to +/- 0.1 miles is sufficient for each turn, but try to keep an accurate running total. It is hard to determine distances within +/- 1 percent, but a +/- 3 percent error is not very good. 
<p>
Some typical abbreviations are listed below: 
<p>
R = right <br>
BR = bear right <br>
L = left <br>
BL = bear left <br>
ST = straight (denotes a major crossing) <br>
X = cross <br>
+ = intersection <br>
RR = railroad tracks (caution) 
<p>
Compass or route directions
<p>
N, S, E, W <br>
NW, NE <br>
SW, SE <br>
e.g. US-2 E (US Route 2 heading east)
<p>
Where there are long stretches between controls, it is helpful to note the location (and hours of operation) of services available.
<p>
When the route includes mountain passes, it is very useful to the riders to indicate summits on the route sheet (and the road milepost as well).
<p>
The route sheet should include emergency numbers for a rider to use in case of difficulty or to inform the organizer that the rider has abandoned the brevet.
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Cards"></a><b>Brevet Cards</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Prepare brevet cards for the riders. Masters can be found on the RUSA website at <a href="http://www.rusa.org/rbakit.html" target="_blank">http://www.rusa.org/rbakit.html</a> or SIR template cards may be used as models (see below). Brevet cards should be printed on sturdy card stock. Where there are more control points than will fit on one card, two cards may be prepared for each rider.
<p>

<a href="SIRBrevetCardInside.doc">SIRBrevetCardInside.doc</a> (Word doc)<br>
<a href="SIRBrevetCardOutside.doc">SIRBrevetCardOutside.doc</a> (Word doc)
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that there are different card formats for different events. The SIR template cards are only for ACP brevets. For other events - populaires, RUSA brevets, etc - please either use the relevant master template from the <A HREF="http://www.rusa.org/rbakit.html" TARGET="_blank">RUSA website</A> or make conforming modifications to the SIR template. If in doubt, check with RBA to determine if an event is a RUSA or ACP event.
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Description"></a><b>Brevet Description</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Publish a general route description in SIR newsletter and/or website a few months ahead of the ride. A sample description can be found <A HREF="../rides/ride_archive/200km/200km_1_2005Desc.html">here</a>.
<p>
The route description should include start time and date, contact information for the brevet organizer, exact ride fees, support included in ride fees, any special requirements such as reflective vests, and control abnormalities such as no restrooms or no water. Orient this description to help riders plan equipment, resources, and schedule. 
<p>
The route description should mention if any shared sleeping arrangements are included in the brevet fee or whether overnight accommodations should be arranged by riders themselves. The ride fee and amount of support should be kept to a minimum in the spirit of the self-supported randonneur.
<p>
The true spirit of randonneuring is that of a self-supported long-distance adventurous tourist.  The amount of support SIR typically provides is probably the middle ground of level of support provided in various areas of the country and fairly well equivalent to larger events such as RM1200, BMB, and PBP.  It is up to the brevet organizer to determine that amount of support they will provide.  No matter what the support level will be, the brevet organizer must make note of this in the brevet description.  This is particularly important if little or no support will be provided.  If limited support will be provided, the brevet description should include where riders need to be additionally prepared for long stretches of few or no services.
<p>
The usual member fees are (200 km - $10; 300 km - $15; 400 km - $25; 600 km - $40; 1000 km - $75). Non-member fees are $10 more (see Brevet Expenses below).
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Expenses"></a><b>Brevet Expenses</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
SIR does not normally reimburse for route scouting, cost of maps, or other indirect costs. SIR would expect the brevet organizer and officials to be reimbursed for the cost of setting up an overnight control location or minimal food support at a control where other food options are not available. Organizers may also be reimbursed for food provided at the beginning and end of the ride. In the interest of rider safety on rides of 400 km or longer, organizers are encouraged to provide sleeping facilities at the finish. The cost of such facilities will be borne by SIR. Costs of printing route sheets and brevet cards are also reimbursable. Any unusual expenditures should be presented in advance to the RBA and/or the SIR Board for approval and figured into the cost of the brevet entry.
<p>
It is reasonable to ask for voluntary monetary contributions from brevet riders if an unexpectedly low turnout or other unavoidable and unforeseen minor expenses occur. Voluntary contributions may also be solicited for providing overnight control facilities beyond the minimum if the provision of such facilities would otherwise cause the ride expenses to substantially exceed receipts. Riders will normally be understanding and supportive.
<p>
The cost of a brevet has been thought through and is designed to cover the costs of any single brevet.  As you plan the brevet keep in mind your expenses versus the income from brevet fees.  All brevets (except for perhaps the 1000km) should be able to cover all their own expenses as best as possible - the club cannot afford to regularly dip into the club reserves to fund excess brevet expenses.
<p>
This doesn't mean you should spend every bit of income as well.  There are expenses per brevet - such as insurance - that need to be taken into account.  Don't forget that income from membership fees and medals is not income for the brevet and should not be used for brevet expenses. Try to plan a buffer of $100-$150, i.e. income should exceed expenses by that much.  Any surplus is a bonus for the club and will be used for other club expenses such as Populaire medals, jersey designs etc. 
<p>
Here are some tips for expenses:
<ul>

	<li> Plan on one hotel room per 4-6 riders planning on staying at any one checkpoint.
	<li> We don't reimburse for motel rooms for riders before a ride. If necessary we will reimburse 1 room for organizer use the night before.
	<li> For post-ride motel rooms for riders to rest/sleep, there should be 1-3 rooms only. In most cases, rooms for riders are needed only after 400km (and possibly 300km events). For 600km and 1000km events, one room for organizer use is usually sufficient.

	<li> If you provide food wait until after the ride starts to get food.  That way you can do a count of riders and buy an appropriate amount of food.</li>
	<li> For food provided on route, a rough estimate for food expenses is $1-$2 per rider per checkpoint where food will be provided.  This can be a little more for overnight checkpoints. Plan on approximately 1 gallon of water for every 5 riders per checkpoint where food will be provided - more if it's quite warm.</li>
	<li> When shopping, for pop, usually cans are cheaper than liters and will last longer. Buy generic brands, look at the per oz. cost listed at the grocery store, buy a variety.  If you get lunchmeat, riders prefer turkey to anything else.  Try not to get too much food that can spoil or would have to be thrown away at the end of the ride.</li>
	<li> Check with the club supplies before buying napkins, plates, plasticware, cups, etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="Before"></a><b>Before the Brevet Date</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Obtain the brevet organizer care package from the RBA or from the organizer of the previously scheduled SIR brevet. The package should include SIR control signs, liability waiver forms, stamps and pads, a clipboard, pens, card stock for brevet cards, etc.
<p>
Make sufficient route sheets and cards for the expected number of riders and a few extras for unexpected riders. Make these up well in advance. 
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with making control cards, the SIR board can assist with determining control point times and route sheet details. 
<p>
Have someone available as backup brevet organizer in case you can not make it to the ride because of an emergency. 
<p>
Have someone who has done it before help you if you are a new organizer, so you can learn the ropes. Co-organizing is easier, more fun, and more members will be ready to lead a Brevet next year!
<p>
The brevet organizer may pre-ride the course up to 8 days before the ride and get brevet credit by following the SIR and RUSA rules. The brevet organizer may take along other ride volunteers or other riders. Normally these riders would be required to stay together. Only riders specifically invited by the organizer may pre-ride. The brevet organizer has the right to turn down a request to ride along. A pre-ride of a route is not required if it is well known. We do not advertise these pre-rides normally because we want only people we know and trust on them. Only one brevet result will be submitted for certification for a rider who chooses to ride both on the pre-ride and on the official brevet date. Any questions about pre-rides should be directed to the Regional Brevet Administrator, whose decisions are final.
<p>
There are no "make-up" rides. If you miss a brevet you'll need to look at the other series in Portland or British Columbia. Plan ahead!

<p>
<a name="Materials"></a><b>Brevet Start Materials</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Prior to the day of the brevet, the organizer should ensure that he or she will have the following items available at the brevet start:
<p>
___	Brevet cards<br>
___	Route sheets<br>
___	"Zip-lock"-type plastic bags to protect control cards/route sheets<br>
___	A blank SIR Brevet Sign-up Sheet (<a href="SIR_Reg_Template.htm">HTML</a> or <a href="SIR_Reg_Template.xls">Excel Worksheet)<br>
___	Liability Waiver Forms</a> (<a href="SIR_waiver.doc">MS Word doc</a>)<br>
___	<a href="SIR_application.html">SIR Membership Application forms</a><br>
___	<a href="http://www.rusa.org/join.html" target="_blank">RUSA Membership Application forms</a><br>
___	<a href="http://www.rusa.org/Download/members_by_name.txt" target="_blank">Current RUSA Membership List</a> (Optional)<br>
___	Copy of <A HREF="SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Rider Expectations</A> for rider review<br>
___	Pens<br>
___ SIR Brevet sign-up sheet from Treasurer with current roster.
<p>
The brevet sign-up sheet should list SIR members in the first column along with space to write-in non-member riders. There should be columns for (a) the riders RUSA number, (b) check-off that the waiver has been signed, (c) the brevet fee, (d) the medal fee, (e) SIR membership fee, (f) RUSA membership fee, (g) voluntary contributions, if any, (h) checks received, (i) cash received, (j) finish time. A sample SIR Brevet Sign-up Sheet can be seen <a href="SIR_Reg_Template.htm">here</a> (an <a href="SIR_Reg_Template.xls">Excel Worksheet version is also available</a>). The current list of SIR members may be obtained from the <a href="mailto:treasurer2006@seattlerandonneur.org">SIR Treasurer</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Procedures"></a><b>Brevet Start Procedures and Checklist</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Be at the start of the ride 45 minutes to an hour (up to 1.5 hours in advance, especially for the shorter, well attended rides) before the brevet start time to check in riders. The following items need to be completed for each rider.
<p>
___	Have the rider sign the liability waiver and note this on the sign-up sheet<br>
___	Collect fees (see Rider Fees below) and note them on the sign-up sheet<br>
___	Provide the rider with brevet card, route sheet, and zip-lock bag<br>
___	Have the rider fill out the back of the brevet card, especially their address and RUSA membership number
<p>
If more than one brevet (i.e., multiple distances) are scheduled together, the brevet organizer MUST ask each rider to sign in on the brevet sign-up sheet for the appropriate brevet. RUSA requires that the originals of these forms be mailed to RUSA in order for any rider to get credit for the brevets. (This is to avoid any chance that a rider can sign up for a longer brevet and then cut it short and request credit for the shorter distance).
<p>
The brevet organizer or organizers may perform informal safety inspections as a courtesy to riders. The brevet organizer may disqualify a rider for unsafe equipment. The rider will sign a form saying they are responsible for their equipment, but this could help prevent some problems. 
<p>
The safety check might include such things as: Working lights, check to see extra batteries, extra bulbs, sufficient clothes, reflective gear, wheels properly secured into frame, handlebars not loose, brake releases closed and sufficiently adjusted to stop the bike, sufficient tire pressure, tire pump, patch kit, sufficient water on a hot day, stuff that could fall off and hit another rider, like loose bottles, lights, pump, fenders, helmet, etc. 
<p>
Give riders a 10-minute and 2 minute warning of the start. Give riders a quick pre-ride briefing to call their attention to last-minute route changes, construction alerts, special route-finding issues, services availability, etc. Make every effort to get all riders off at the exact starting time. Wait one hour after the start for any late starters. Note that the brevet organizer can do the ride also and not wait around if this is explained in the newsletter and the RBA has approved. 
<p>
During the ride the brevet organizers have no responsibility other than secret controls or any support specifically noted in the ride description.
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="Fees"></a><b>Rider Fees</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Ok, listen up, this gets detailed. The brevet organizer should be prepared to collect (1) brevet fees, (2) medal fees, (3) SIR membership fees (and forms), (4) RUSA membership fees (and forms), and (5) voluntary contributions for lodging.
<p>
<b>Brevet fees.</b> As noted above, there are two different brevet fees for each brevet, one for Members and one for non-members. A definition is in order: A "Member" is a person who is BOTH a member of SIR and a member of his or her "national randonneuring organization." For US nationals, the national randonneuring organization is RUSA, so for US riders a Member is a rider who is both a SIR and a RUSA member. For non-US nationals, a national randonneuring organization is an organization in their country that is a direct correspondent with ACP, such as Audax UK or Audax Australia. In Canada there are several such direct correspondents, including BC Randonneurs.
<p>
Riders who are not Members pay the higher brevet fee which is $10 higher for all brevets. For US riders, the brevet organizer should verify current SIR and RUSA membership via current membership lists (see Brevet Start Materials above for how to obtain these). For non-US riders, it's basically an honor system, but make note of the name of their organization.
<p>
<b>Medal fees.</b> Riders need not order medals, it's their option. The medal fee is $8. The brevet organizer can take medal orders ONLY from Members.
<p>
<b>Membership fees.</b> Riders may apply for SIR and/or RUSA membership at the brevet start and get the benefit of the lower member brevet fee. The brevet organizer should collect the SIR application form, checking for completeness, and the $10 (email newsletters) or $15 (USPS newsletters) membership fee. For riders who are not current members of RUSA (or other national randonneuring organization), the brevet organizer should also collect the RUSA application form and the $20 membership fee.
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<a name="After"></a><b>After the Brevet</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Collect all stamped cards at the end of the brevet. Be sure to note the time if you collect cards at the end of brevet. Double check card before letting rider leave. Make sure that it has been signed by the rider. Sign the card on the line for brevet organizer's signature.
<p>
If the final control is not attended by a SIR official, give specific instructions to riders on how to handle brevet cards at the finish - leaving at designated local establishment or sending to organizer. Otherwise, riders can expect to simply leave their control card at the final control with a SIR official. 
<p>
Within TEN days of the brevet, submit all results and paperwork, as follows:
<p>
<ol compact type="1" start="1">
	<li> Send to the <a href="mailto:RBA@seattlerandonneur.org">RBA</a> via e-mail the list of finishers, their RUSA membership numbers, finish times, and medal orders. Include also a description (who and why) for all DNFs.
	<li> Send to the <A HREF="../newsletters.html">newsletter editor</A> via e-mail a brief report on the brevet. This may include the riders and finish times, but these results should not be published until confirmed by the RBA.
	<li> Send or deliver the following items to the SIR Treasurer:
	<ul><li>a. The completed sign-up sheet
	<li>b. All fees collected (it is preferable to send a personal check for all cash collected along with the individual checks received)
	<li>c. An accounting for all expenses, with receipts. See <A HREF="05BrevetIncomeReport.pdf">Brevet Income Report</A> (PDF).
	<li>d. SIR and RUSA membership applications received</ul>
	<li> Send or deliver the completed brevet cards and liability waiver forms to the RBA
	<li> Return the brevet organizer care package to the RBA or deliver it to the organizer of the next scheduled SIR brevet.
</ol>
<p>
The SIR Treasurer will send a reimbursement check to the brevet organizer for the ride expenses.
<p>
The RBA will retain the control cards until the brevet certification stickers are received from RUSA. At the end of the year, the RBA will see that they get to the individual riders along with any medals ordered. 
<p>
The brevet organizer may use the RBA and/or the SIR Board to help clarify a rule or make a decision such as whether a rider is capable of attempting a ride. In such situations, the brevet organizer should gather all relevant information and use the SIR officials in an advisory mode.

The checklist is fairly basic, and will be similar to that of a brevet
organizer.  So much of the time is devoted to reviewing team routes that
everything else becomes a blur.  But, I think I noted most of them.  If I
missed any thing, please add it to the list.
<p>
<ul compact type="disc">
	<li> Select destination
	<li> Make banquet arrangements
	<li> Depending upon banquet facility requirements, communicate current number of attendees-for Semiahmoo: 1 or 2 weeks before the event & the night before the banquet.
	<li> Solicite entries, communicate banquet and other event details &amp; note registration requirements: Standard event requirements, plus application deadline
	<li> Respond to rider/captain questions
	<li> Review team routes to insure compliance with event requirements, communicate route issues, rereview routes, etc.
	<li> Prepare and supply control cards, insurance/waiver forms
	<li> Validate results, forward to RBA
	<li> Account to Treasurer on receipts and expenditures
</ul>
<p>
Wish list: Operate a secret control process (I like what BC Randonneurs do).
