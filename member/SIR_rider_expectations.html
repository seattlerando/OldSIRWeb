<blockquote>
SIR brevet participants must ride safely, obey all rules of the road, wear helmets, and follow RUSA and SIR rules, as well as any specific requirements outlined by the brevet organizer. Riders are expected to be familiar with the RUSA/ACP Rules for Riders. These may be found at <a href="http://www.rusa.org/brvreg.html" target="_blank">http://www.rusa.org/brvreg.html</a>.</p>

<p align="left">
Brevet participants should be aware of the inherent risks of long-distance cycling and must understand that they have responsibility for their own safety. Riding day and night in all kinds of weather on roads shared with cars and trucks can be dangerous. Riders are responsible to ensure that they are qualified, in good health, and in proper physical condition to participate in the brevets. Each rider is responsible for ensuring that his or her bicycle and other equipment are safe and appropriate for the brevets. Each rider is responsible for making his or her own decisions to stay safe at all times.</p>

<p align="left">
Scheduled SIR brevets are available on the SIR website - <a href="http://www.seattlerandonneur.org/" target="_blank">http://www.seattlerandonneur.org</a>. Members are advised to check the web site often for updates.
</p>

<p align="left">
Riders should understand their training and capabilities in deciding to attempt a ride. Typically, it is reasonable for a rider to move up one distance from a previously completed RUSA sanctioned brevet in the same or previous season or to attempt a brevet of equal distance completed within the last four seasons. Assume the basic "Super Randonneur" series of 200 km, 300 km, 400 km, 600 km, 1200 km brevets, but where 1200 km and 1000 km are treated equally.
</p>

<p align="left">
The SIR newsletter and/or website will give a brief route description of each Brevet so riders may plan equipment and support.  Ride fees will be published in the SIR newsletter and/or website.  The SIR newsletter will provide information on joining RUSA and SIR. 
</p>

<P ALIGN="left">
The brevet organizer will have an address and contact information listed in the SIR newsletter and/or website.  Brevet organizers will address rider questions within 10 days.  Within the week preceding a brevet, questions will be addressed in two days.  Calling the night before a brevet is risky.
</P>

<p align="left">
<blockquote>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required.  Note that some taillights are also legal reflectors.  These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function.  Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times.  Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group.  Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother some other riders.  The brevet organizer may waive lighting requirements on 200 km brevets. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Reflective vests and leg bands are recommended for riding at night or during poor visibility and may be required by the brevet organizer.  This is for your safety and others in the group. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Backup headlights and taillights, extra bulbs, and extra batteries are recommended and may be required by the brevet organizer.  Hand held flashlights or headlamps are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
</p>

<p align="left">
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended.  Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.</p>

<p align="left">
Helmets are required.</p>

<a name="Start"><b>Brevet Start</b></a>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
There will be arrangements at the start of the ride to accept a RUSA application form, a SIR application form, and collect any ride or medal fees.  Brevet organizers will be available at least 30 minutes before the official start time.  Bring exact change or a check, or better yet, sign up in advance. The usual member fees are (200 km - $10; 300 km - $15; 400 km - $25; 600 km - $40; 1000 km - $50). Non-member fees are more. Check the website brevet description for the exact fee for a brevet, or contact the brevet organizer. Medal fees are extra.
</p>

<p align="left">
Be ready to register for the ride from 20 to 40 minutes before the official brevet start time.  Unless otherwise stated in advance, the brevet organizer normally waits 1 hour after the official brevet start time.  All timing starts at the official brevet start time regardless of a late rider's actual starting time.
</p>

<p align="left">
SIR will provide some liability insurance protection, but riders are ultimately responsible for their own liability protection.  This is even more crucial for medical coverage, as the SIR coverage is nominal and has a large deductible.  Riders will be required to sign a waiver absolving SIR and the volunteer ride organizers of any liability.
</p>
 
<p align="left">
Each rider will receive a brevet card and navigational instructions in the form of a route sheet.  Maps are not generally provided.
</p>

<P ALIGN="left">
Riders who have notified the brevet organizer in advance are given preference if shortages occur of any resource.  Normally, there are a few extra copies of route sheets.
</P>

<a name="During"><b>During the Brevet</b></a>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">
Riders are on their own and need to arrange for their own transportation and assistance if they abandon the brevet.  Any rider abandoning the brevet must notify the brevet organizer or SIR official.  Randonneurs are expected to be totally self-supported except as published in the ride description or specifically informed by the brevet organizer. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Riders are responsible for their own route-finding. Navigational instructions will include route sheet with description and distance (in miles and kilometers) of each major turn and control point. 
</p>

<p align="left">
The brevet card will indicate the opening and closing times of each control.  Some rider judgment may be needed to compensate for minor accidental route sheet errors. If the final control is not manned by a SIR official, you must get a final control stamp at the control and mail your brevet card to the Regional Brevet Administrator. After the ride, your brevet card will be kept by the RBA until the end of the season. They will be returned with the brevet certification stickers from RUSA/ACP as well as a medal (if ordered).
</p>

<p align="left">
Controls will generally have water and restrooms, with exceptions noted in the route description.
</p>

<p align="left">
Riders must carry their own tools, spare parts, extra clothes, food and water.  Brevet riders may assist one another on the road with minor repairs, food, and water. Riding in small self-organized groups is highly recommended for safety. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Non-rider support is only allowed at the controls.  Riders may stop anywhere at stores or restaurants. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Drafting other official brevet riders is allowed.  Extra space and caution is recommended for longer rides. 
</p>

<p align="left">
Aerobars are allowed on brevets if used safely.  Riders who expect to participate in Paris-Brest-Paris should avoid becoming dependent on them.  Many experienced riders choose not to use aerobars.</blockquote>

<a name="Rules"><B>Rules Enforcement:</B></a>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<blockquote>All riders are reminded that any failure to conduct the ride in accordance with these SIR Brevet Rider Expectations, the RUSA rules for riders, applicable laws, or any special instructions or equipment requirements for this ride may result in a warning, time penalty, or disqualification.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The brevet organizer has primary responsibility for administering the rules and imposing penalties. The organizer may consult with the SIR board in determining any appropriate penalties. Where possible, the organizer or the board will request an explanation of the rule violation from the rider involved.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Any ruling may be appealed to the SIR Board.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Article 15 of the RUSA/ACP rules for riders permit a further appeal to Randonneurs USA.</blockquote>
