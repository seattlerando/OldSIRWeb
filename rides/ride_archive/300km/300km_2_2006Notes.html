Pre Ride Report and rider notes:<BR>
The pre-ride was held on Saturday, 29 August 2006.<BR>
Pre riders: Dan Turner, Dave Reed, Vick Ringvist and Steve Hameister.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We rolled out just after 6:00 AM with and overcast sky with temperatures in
the upper 50's.  On Northshore drive, we found some freshly ground
pavement, not too bad but riders should be careful. After turning left, we
climbed the Yew street hill. Grades are as steep as 9 percent, but the climb
isn't too long. After a nice decent to Samish Way, there's another little
climb on Samish then a descent down to Lake Samish. The veer left onto East
Lake Samish can sneak up on you... so be ready. Now we're on some roads
familiar to many SIR folks from E. Lake Samish, Nulle Road, Lake Samish
Road, Colony, Ershig and Bow Hill.  The store at Edison Station doesn't
open till 9:00 A.M., so we'll be manning the control until the store opens.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We enjoyed a nice tail wind and beautiful views on the run along Chuckanut
Drive. At Fairhaven in South Bellingham, SIR riders will be mingling with the RSVP crowd as they leave the Fairhaven area. At East Holly, our ride turns West
and down along the water front, leaving the RSVP folks. We rode tailwinds on
Hannegan Rd. heading North up to Everson and the second control.  An easy
climb up South Pass road and a few short rollers on Silver Lake Rd up to the
third control at Silver Lake Park. There are a couple of dogs on Silver
Lake road that may make you sprint for points. They did seem to respond to
"NO!" or "GO HOME!" From the park we drop down to Maple Falls and begin a
very easy gradual climb up to Glacier.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The town of Glacier is the Midpoint of the ride. To this point, the
climbing has been a modest has been a modest 4390 feet.  Glacier is an
open control. There are restrooms at the trail head parking lot South of
Graham's market.  Milano's serves great Italian food. We return to Silver
Lake Park for the next control. At Kendell Road we turn right and have some
nice smooth pavement for a quick descent down to Sumas. No control at
Sumas, but if it's a hot day, you may want to fill up your water bottles
there. Next, we head slightly south of town to stay off the main, busy part
of HWY 9. We head west on Clearbrook Rd and then back north to Halverstick
Road.  We turn west on Halverstick and basically head west along the
border. Here you'll see border surveillance cameras, border patrol agents
and maybe some minutemen. Sorry, you'll be riding on chip seal, while
across the ditch in Canada, you long for the nice smooth pavement. Do not
cross the ditch. We will not bail you out for border violations. On the
second stretch of Boundary Ave, there is about a mile of nasty fresh chip
seal, be careful!  
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
A straight shot west on H street takes you all the way into Blaine. There
are some long rollers here. If the weather is clear, you'll have the
dropping sun in your face. You'll be happy you filled your water bottles in
Sumas. Go all the way West to the T and turn right on Peace Portal Dr. to
the Chevron station for the next Control.  Turning South at Blaine, we had
a small head wind down through Birch Bay. We cleared through the Control at
Birch Bay State Park at a little before 7:30. The park closes at dusk,
bikes can still get through, but after the park closes, we'll put the
control at the park entrance. The last 20+ miles are mostly on smooth
pavement with good shoulders.  Fast riders will likely finish in daylight
and I expect we'll see some blistering times, mid speed riders will likely
have 1-2 hours of riding in the twilight and dark. True randonneurs can
expect even more night riding.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
There will be secret controls to ensure route integrity. Everyone agreed
that this is a great 300 km course.

Pre-ride finish time: 15 hours 40 Minutes.<BR>
Total elevation gain: 6640 ft (Polar 720)
