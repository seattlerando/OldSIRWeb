Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $10.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride.  RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.<br>
<p>
Equipment Needed - Remember riding gear for inclement weather just in case, bike tools and spare tubes, and food/water for yourself.   Please see the "<a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">Expectations</a>" section of the SIR web site from whence the following has been excerpted:  For the 400 km, the following equipment is REQUIRED:                                          
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required.  Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors.  These may be checked and riders may be disqualified if they do not function.  Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times.  Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group.  Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother some other riders.                                            
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required.  This is for your safety and the safety of others in the group.                                          
<p>
Multiple redundant headlights, taillights, extra bulbs, and extra batteries are STRONGLY recommended, and may be required by the brevet leader.  Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.                                          
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are STRONGLY recommended.  Additional rear splashguards (or "courtesy flaps") are recommended for group riding. Note: Fenders are never required, only recommended.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> This is a spectacular route with widely varied terrain and lots of climbing.  Training from previous brevets over Mountain Passes is the best experience to determine if you are prepared for this course. The route includes three South Cascade Passes; White Pass (4500'), Chinook Pass (5430') and Cayuse Pass (4675').  From the King's Motel we follow the RAMROD course to within ten miles of the Rainier National Park entrance, then take idyllic Skate Creek Road to Packwood, head East on Hwy 12 up and over White Pass, followed by an exhilarating descent to Rimrock Lake & gentle downhill grades to Hwy 410.  At the "T" we cross onto Old Naches Hwy for a brief meander through orchards to Naches, then continue on US-12 to Yakima.  After returning on US-12 to Hwy 410, we proceed through Cliffdell then up the steeper grades to Chinook Pass (SIR support greets you at the rest area).  From the summit there is a fast descent with switchbacks to Cayuse Pass, then another long descent to Crystal Mtn Blvd where the road widens and smoothes out through the valley to Enumclaw.  There are no services open at night between Cayuse Pass and Enumclaw.
<p>
