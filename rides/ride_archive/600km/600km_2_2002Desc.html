<b>Special Instruction:</b>
<p>
Reach the ferry terminal in Edmonds in time to catch the 5:50am ferry in order to make it to the start on time. Ferry schedule and information: <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ed-king" target="_blank">http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ed-king</a>.
<p>
Equipment needed: Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="600km_2_2002Route.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Kingston Ferry Terminal.
<p>
<b>Bag Drop:</b> There will be a bag drop service to Aberdeen. Mark will be in line with my car on the Edmonds side and can accept drop bags there or at the start in Kingston.
<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Kingston Ferry Terminal.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> We will make a complete circuit of the Olympic Peninsula. From the start in Kingston, we¹ll head across the Hood Canal Bridge and follow SR-104 and US-101 to Port Angeles. From there we¹ll take the Strait of Juan de Fuca Highway (SR-112) to Clallam Bay and then south back to US-101. The route passes through Folks, Kalalock, and Amanda Park on the way to the overnight stop in Aberdeen. From Aberdeen we go east on US-12 and back roads to McCleary and Kamilche, where the route picks up US-101 again for the trip up the west side of the Hood Canal back to the bridge and the finish at Kingston.
