<B>Driving instruction:</B> Packwood is located 64 miles east of I-5 on Highway 12. Chose your most direct route.

<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b> Given the distance to the start location for most riders you may want to consider overnight accomodations for Friday in Packwood. The start time is 5AM so the wise randonneur will make arrangements to spend the night in Packwood Friday to be fresh Saturday morning.  We will be based out of the annex to the Hotel Packwood which is a very cool old boarding house with many rooms set up to share with thrifty riders. Rooms 1-7 use 2 shared bathrooms.  We will be at the annex across the road and will have shower facilities and some bed space for post-ride but you may want to get a room for both Friday and Saturday to ensure a real bed.  Room rates are very reasonable. <A HREF="http://www.packwoodwa.com/Hotel%20Packwood.htm" TARGET="_blank">Hotel Packwood</A> (360) 494-5431.
<p>
The climb to Baby Shoe Pass is gravel/pack dirt for 7 miles, the descent from Baby Shoe Pass is gravel/pack dirt for 3 miles. Please use caution. No wimpy 700-23 race tires or you're asking for trouble.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>

<b>Route Description:</b>This route will take you close to three of Washington's volcanos, Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helen's, and Mt. Adams. It is a challenging route with lots of climbing and about 10 miles of unpaved roads. There are few to no services between controls and no cell phone service. Carry plenty of food and water. The ride starts in Packwood, heads west to Randle then south into the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. You will climb to Baby Shoe Pass on the west side of Mt. Adams then descend to the small town of Trout Lake. From Trout Lake you will wind your way north and west to Eagle Cliff on the Lewis River then head north for a long climb on the east side of Mt. St. Helen's to Elk Summit. From Elk Summit there is a long descent to Randle then east on Highway 12 back to Packwood. The majority of this ride is in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on small paved roads with very little car traffic and some great views. Cumulative elevation gain is about 11,600 feet. This will be a true randonneuring experience!
