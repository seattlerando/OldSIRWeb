<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b> Reach the Coleman Dock in downtown Seattle in time to catch the 6:20am ferry in order to make it to the start on time. Ferry schedule and information: <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=sea-bi" target="_blank">http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=sea-bi</a>. 
We start early to miss some traffic and to make most everyone can finish before dark.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Free on street parking is available south of the ferry terminal on Alaska Way, or about a mile north of the ferry terminal on Elliott Ave., just north of Pier 70 (N bound lane, at the Airborne Express HQ building.) Or, ride your bike to the ferry.
<p>
<b> Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the SIR Brevet Riders Expectations - see <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">http://www.seattlerandonneur.org/member/SIR_rider_expectations.html </a>
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>

<b>Route Description:</b> The route for the 300K has been changed slightly.  The change is so we don't end up crossing the Hood Canal Bridge twice - once at night as well.  The route will still start from Bainbridge Island, we'll head up to Port Hadlock and then on to Port Townsend for the first control.  Then south on SR 20 to catch Hwy 101 all the way to Shelton.  At Shelton we'll turn around and head north about 9 miles on 101, then right on Hwy 106 to Belfair, then Bremerton and follow SR 3 back up to Poulsbo and finally the home stretch back down Bainbridge Island.
<p>
This route will be similar to the Spring 300K, but without the Tahuya Hills.  The first 40 miles to Port Hadlock will be challenging with plenty of rollers.  From Port Hadlock to Port Townsend is a little flatter while on the plateau, then a few rollers to 101.  Then 15 miles of relatively flat to Quilcene.  Then Mount Walker and then rollers along the west side of the Hood Canal.  The hills to Shelton are longer, but not as steep.  Then a nice 20 miles of flat on SR 106, a shallow incline over Old Belfair Hwy to Bellingham and then the smooth wide shoulder of Hwy 3 back to Poulsbo and then the final miles to Bainbridge Island.
