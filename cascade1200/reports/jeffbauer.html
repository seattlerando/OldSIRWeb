<B>Prologue</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Last year I missed riding the Cascade 1200K because I wanted to complete the
Gold Rush Randonne. This year four of us from Tennessee trained together
to ride the Cascade 1200K in Washington State.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Just days before the ride we receive news that the roads connecting Randle
to Carson are closed because the snow hasn't been removed. I start packing
more cold weather gear in anticipation of cool evenings. We won't get to see St. Helens on this trip, but the amazing thing is that SIR quickly re-routes the course in short order -- an amazing logistical feat.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
After we arrive and assemble our bikes I discover that my rear brake has
been damaged in transit. We travel to three different bike shops, finally
obtaining a cheap $20 brake and then locate a mechanic willing to install it
on his lunch hour. After a quick bike inspection we have dinner and get to
bed.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Monroe - mile 0<BR>
6/24 06:00</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The morning is slightly chilly. I've worn my white long sleeve jersey for
sun protection, but it's also comfortable in the cool morning hours. For
once I manage to start my ride at a conservative pace. I ride with Will
Roberts for a while, reminiscing about the Rocky Mountain 1200K a couple
years ago. He's still riding a single-speed, but I'm no longer doing these
distances on my fixed-gear. We ride together through the morning mist.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Cumberland - mile 52<BR>
6/24 09:16</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
A relatively quick stop. Water but no food, unless you count gumdrops.
Gumdrops? I was hoping to eat something more substantial this early in the
ride. Alan experiences some clicking noises on his bike. It's warming up
and anyone who was wearing a vest or arm warmers has already removed them.
We can see Mt. Ranier up ahead in the distance.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Kapowsin (secret control) - mile 83<BR>
6/24 11:15</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Jennifer Wise and Pierce Grafan are waiting at the secret control. Perhaps
a secret control is mandatory for a 1200K ride, as this one doesn't
otherwise appear to serve any useful purpose. Just as we descend from the
control, I recall the Pierce is a bike mechanic and could have diagnosed
Alan's problem. Too late. We pass a rider with a flat.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Eatonville - mile 94<BR>
6/24 12:05</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Ten miles out of the secret control we stop at the Plaza Market in
Eatonville. I regret not stopping a mile earlier at the Truly Scrumptious
Bakery. We take a long 40 minute break to eat and replenish, then head out
toward Randle. Somewhere along the route our road is closed due to a
festival. We simply ride slowly around the pedestrians and the market
booths. I'd like to stop for a snow cone, but we keep pedalling. As we
come to the next street we encounter a parade -- some skateboarders are led
by a fire engine. Rather than wait for the parade to end, we simply become
part of the parade, waving to people as we pass through.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Randle - mile 140<BR>
6/24 16:07</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Before we get to the next control, we stop in Morton and take pictures of a
passenger-carrying steam locomotive. It's very hot by the time we arrive in
Randle. The market is crowded and the cold drinks aren't cold. We've been
warned to stock up on water before we leave, as we'll have a long climb up
White Pass with no services. Despite leaving Randle with two (2) 30oz water
bottles and a 50oz Camelbak, I run out of water before reaching the summit.
I think almost everyone misjudged how much water we'd require.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>White Pass - mile 176<BR>
6/24 17:47</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
About 24 miles outside of Randle the 13 mile climb begins in earnest. Jeff,
Bill, Alan and I are more or less together, though we climb at different
rates. We occasionally stop for the scenic views to take pictures -- also an excuse to take a breather during this long ascent. The grade isn't too steep, but it's relentless. A support vehicle pulls up and asks if I'm okay.
Stupidly, I reply affirmative when I could have taken the opportunity to
refill my water.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
As we're climbing up White Pass we encounter brief thermoclines -- areas
where a breeze passes through the upper snow and cold water to provide a
short respite from the heat. As we ascend, the air starts to cool due to
the change in altitude.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
I catch up with Michelle just before the summit. She has also run out of
water and was sorely tempted to drink from the mountain runoff, but
fortunately a SAG vehicle intervened. Apparently some riders were asking
for water from the tourists at the scenic lookouts.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
At the control summit we have food and drinks waiting. I eat a turkey sandwich as Jeff, Alan, and Bill arrive. I'm being bitten by mosquitoes, however, and soon head down the pass before everyone else is ready to depart.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Prior to this climb we'd all misjudged how easy the ride had been going. At
the top of White Pass some riders were obviously irritable -- a bad omen of
things yet to come.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Cowiche - mile 220 (Overnight)<BR>
6/24 23:03</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
I pedal at an easy pace towards Cowiche, our first overnight control. The
terrain is mostly downhill, with a few minor climbs. It gets dark before
I've completed the descent as I've stopped to put on night gear and take a
few photos, including a particularly nice one of a sunset over the mountain
lake.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The last miles are pleasant, with the exception of one steep grind before
Cowiche. Just as I turn into the overnight control, I hear Bill, Alan, and
Jeff behind me with Michelle in tow. They joke about my "soft pedalling"
over the past 44 miles.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The overnight control is the St. Peter's Youth Center. We have bunk beds, hot showers and a hot meal. Great accommodations, especially considering that SIR had to improvise at this location. We decide to attempt a 5:00 am departure.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Ellensburg - mile 269<BR>
6/25 09:43</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
A quick breakfast and we're on the road before 6:00. Accounting for showers and meals, we probably got 3 hours of actual sleep. Once we get started, our legs warm up. Then there's an interesting phenomenon. As we're riding along an irrigation ditch the water appears to be running uphill. Of course it's a trick of visual perception -- we're actually riding uphill about 11 mph.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
By 7:00 am, the day is already warm. We've been warned to expect temps in
the upper 90's. As the sun rises, it's obvious that the terrain has changed
dramatically since we've crossed White Pass. Gone are the trees and green
hills. Ahead lies the dusty desert and sagebrush.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
After 20 miles we turn onto Canyon Road. This section is an out-and-back
spur that follows the Yakima River into Ellensburg. We're still riding
early enough in the morning that we get some shade riding up and down
through the canyon. Bill mentions that the popping noise is the road tar
boiling up to the surface. At one point I'm riding beside Michelle and we
hear -- then see -- rocks rolling down into our path. A short sprint, then
I turn around and snap a quick photo. In the photo you can see the dust
kicked up from the rolling rocks.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The last 3 miles into the Flying J control are flat.
We motor along at 20 mph. At the control we stock up on food/water and head
back toward Canyon Road. On the return leg it's much hotter and our progress is slower. Traffic has picked up. Jeff and I ride together and plan to regroup with everyone in Selah, about 29 miles down the road.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Selah - mile 299<BR>
6/25 12:10</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The temps are in the mid 90's by the time we reach at the Selah control.
Jeff and I arrive first, followed by Michelle, then Bill and Alan. Bill
wants to stop at McDonald's. Jeff, Michelle, and I decide to keep riding to
the next control at Sunnyside, about 45 miles down the road.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Sunnyside - mile 345<BR>
6/25 15:58</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
After negotiating through busy traffic, we reach a bike trail. We get some
small bits of shade and even see some riders off-bike, taking advantage of
the shade in the midday heat.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We basically ride conservatively through the afternoon and try to keep
ourselves hydrated. After 3+ hours of grinding through the heat, we finally reach the market in Sunnyside.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Rattlesnake (water) - mile 363<BR>
6/25 18:40</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The cue sheet mentions NO SERVICES for the next 43 miles. Fortunately two angels appear at the Rattlesnake Hills in the form of Sue & Peg. Susan France is a former RAAM racer and the current Oregon RBA. She has brought out tube socks and filled them with ice. Wrapped around our necks, the tube socks provide instant relief from the heat. As the ice melts, the water spreads over our jerseys and rapidly evaporates in the dry heat. From this point on, Sue and Peg would be referred to as the "tube sock ladies".
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Mattawa - mile 393<BR>
6/25 21:32</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Our next goal is to arrive in Mattawa before dark. Michelle is having difficulty keeping our pace, so Jeff and I slow down a bit. After another 32 miles of riding in the heat, we stop briefly at the Vernita Rest Area where we encounter other riders recovering from the heat.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
A mile later we start climbing a section labeled "Yes, up THAT Hill" on the
cue sheet. I drop my tube sock, but can't be bothered to retrieve it.
As I push up toward the final section, I'm humming Wagner's "Also Spracht
Zarathustra" (a.k.a. 2001: Space Odyssey Theme). In response, I hear someone playing a clarinet. A transcendent moment -- listening to notes being played on a clarinet in the middle of the desert as the sun sets. It's Michael, one of the SIR support guys waiting for us at the top of the climb.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Jeff, Michelle, and I regroup and head onward towards Mattawa riding
alongside huge tracts of barley. Half the barley produced in the U.S.
comes from this area. On this point Jeff is reminded that we could sure use
a cold beer.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We're joined by Bill and Alan shortly after we arrive in Mattawa. The five
of us head out together towards Quincy. Once the sun has gone down, the
riding becomes easier. We later hear that the temperatures rose over 100F
today.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Quincy - mile 433<BR>
6/26 02:00</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Shortly after we leave Mattawa, we encounter a long climb. Michelle is
having problems keeping up, so Jeff and I stay with her as Bill and Alan
proceed at their own pace. Not long after we cross I-90, we see an
ambulance up in the distance. With fear bordering on dread, we approach the
carnage. Is it a cyclist? Yes. Is it Bill or Alan? Thank God, no. But it is one of our riders, a victim of a hit-and-run. The rider -- someone I don't recognize -- is being loaded on the gurney as we ride past. The next day we learn that the vehicle and driver have been identified. The rider is the hospital with a broken femur.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The Quincy control is a High School. Ed and Mary show up shortly after our
arrival. We eat, take showers, and sleep on wrestling mats for about an
hour or so. Michelle decides to get some extra sleep. Our pace isn't
matching hers so she'll find someone else to ride with later this morning.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Today will be another hot ride through the desert, so we head out by 6:00
am. As we're leaving I hear the fire alarm -- accidentally tripped by
someone exiting the wrong door. Well, now everyone's awake.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We've been told it will be our easiest day of riding, but I later learn this
is a piece of deliberate(?) misinformation to cheer us up.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Farmer - mile 481<BR>
6/26 11:41</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
After a couple hours, I'm starting to feel the effects of the heat --
dehydration and nausea. I'm able to keep up with everyone, though somewhat slower on the hills.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
There's a cave to our right. Are the flying creatures birds or bats? Bill
and I discuss that whatever is out there are: 1) active in the daylight; 2)
have nests; and 3) aren't flying in bat-flight patterns. Hence they must
be birds, correct? Of course we later learn that they are indeed bats.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
No services for miles and miles. Some nasty cattle guards that are hungry
to dine on our wheels. We encounter Manfred Kuchenmuller who's down with a
broken chain and no chain tool. Bill removes a link and gets Manfred back
on the road in 10 minutes.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The Farmer control looks like a cantina from "Once Upon A Time in the West".
I can almost hear the score from Ennio Morricone in the background. No
electricity or running water. A couple of outhouses around back. The volunteers are enthusiastic, however, and we stock up on food and water. We're reluctant leave so soon as it's the only shaded area for the next 26 miles. We've last heard that about 18 riders have dropped out, mostly due to heat-related conditions.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
As we depart Farmer, we have a series of rollers, then a gradual climb up
McNeil Canyon Road. The 5 mile descent is advertised as fast and dangerous.
None of us enjoy the downhill -- it's too steep and we're riding our brakes
the whole way down, including Bill. I catch up with him then make a quick
detour toward a food packing plant in search of ice. No luck.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
At the bottom of the hill we arrive at Beebe Park around 2:30 pm. It has
running water, shade, and restrooms. We make a decision to wait out the
worst of the afternoon heat and head out around 5pm -- maybe even catch a
brief siesta.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Other people arrive, including Ed and Mary, who think that's a good plan.
We agree to head out together. In the meantime, the tube sock ladies -- Sue and Peg -- have arrived to our cheers of relief. Someone else has brought sandwiches from Subway. I wade into the icy river up to my waist. The temperature contrast almost puts my body in shock. I pretend to sleep on top of a picnic table with a moist tube sock draped over my face. Can it get any better than this?
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We leave Beebe Park at 5pm, still facing intense heat, with the tandem on
point. This is the first chance during the ride I've had much of an
opportunity to chat with Ed and Mary. We have a mutual acquaintance in Mary
Crawley, whom I rode tandem with on the Georgia 300K and 600K brevets.
About 21 miles later we stop at a market in Pateros. It's finally starting to cool down. We're riding in our first section of shade all day and the temperatures have dropped about 10 degrees.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Malott - mile 548<BR>
6/26 20:40</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Another 20 miles takes us into the control at Malott, which is basically an
outdoor park. I'm now starting to chill a bit and put on my vest. We exit
Malott to begin our climb up Loup Loup Pass (elevation 4020).
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The initial portion of the climb is steep, then eases somewhat. But the
ascent is another one of those climbs that never seems to end -- 13 miles of
grinding up Loup Loup Pass. I'm soon joined by Alan and we climb the last
few miles together. I'm already chilly even before we reach the summit. By
the time we get there, we've put on all our warm clothes -- tights, gloves,
vests, jackets -- for the descent. I'm having some problems with my front
brake, so I get passed by everyone on the way down. It's COLD, but we're
back on the western side of the mountains -- trees and grass and milder
temperatures.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We regroup at the bottom of Loup Loup. We have only 25 miles of rolling terrain to the overnight control, but Bill is in serious need of a micro-nap. He mentions that he almost fell asleep on the descent. Alan stays with Bill. I head out with the tandem, onward towards Mazama. We soon overtake groups of riders ahead. This proves problematic for Ed and Mary as they're somewhat tired and need room to maneuver their tandem -- so we back off a bit and let the singles pull ahead of us.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Mazama - mile 600 (Overnight)<BR>
6/27 03:31</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Jeff has arrived just minutes before us in Mazama. I sign up for sleeping quarters and I'm surprised to be escorted by Will Roberts, the single-speed rider. He'd missed his time at the Quincy control and decided to switch from rider to support crew for the remainder of the event. We've been warned to expect as many as four to a room in Mazama, but I'm delighted to find I've got a room to myself, complete with a hot bath. I leave a 5:15 wake up call and drop into a deep, dreamless slumber.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Will wakes me promptly and I stagger over to the breakfast area. I'm not in
a breakfast mood, however, and just grab a bagel and orange juice.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Ed is busy replacing the rear wheel on his tandem and I get a mechanic to
check out my front brake. It turns out my front wheel is slightly out of round and will need to be rebuilt after this ride. Doug makes some minor adjustments to get me through the next 160 miles. Jeff and I depart Mazama around 6:00 am. Just before we leave, four of the Florida riders arrive at the control to the sounds of applause. They'd taken a wrong turn and gotten off course. Ouch.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Marblemount - mile 675<BR>
6/27 14:25</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The next 18 miles is spent climbing up Washington Pass. At 5477 feet, it is
the highest elevation we will ascend. The scenery here is the most stunning
of the entire ride. Incredible rock formations and enormous cascading
waterfalls. After a couple hours of climbing, Jeff and I take a quick
break. We lay our backs into a snow bank to chill down, then resume
climbing. About three hours after we leave Mazama, we reach the summit of
Washington Pass. Once we've stopped climbing it's a bit windy and chilly.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We take photos, put on our vests, and begin our short descent to the base of
Rainy Pass. Another mile of climbing brings us to its summit. Note the
profile shows us mostly descending from Rainy Pass into the next control at
Marblemount: http://tinyurl.com/z5ffk
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
I'm a bit wobbly on the descents with my suspect front wheel/brake and the
severe crosswind pushes our bikes all over the road. Gorgeous scenery --
even if we're too tired to fully appreciate it. As we descend the
temperatures pick up, though nowhere close to what we've experienced the
past two days of desert riding. We take out our tube socks, soak them in
the icy runoff, then apply them over our necks to cool down again.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Jeff and I press on to Marblemount. We make the control with little more
than an hour to spare. We wait for the final riders to show up. The first
control after the overnight stop is usually the most critical. As we head
out with Bill and Alan, the Florida group arrives with 7 minutes to spare.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
At this point we're all pretty drowsy, but the lack of sleep is affecting
Bill probably most severely. There's a nice shaded side road, almost a
grotto -- about 10 miles outside of Darrington. I'm sick of eating energy
bars, so I bum a 3-day old sandwich from Alan. We're soon back on the road
and arrive at the market in Darrington.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
I refill my water and snack on an ice cream sandwich. We have about 40
miles to reach the control in Granite Falls. The tube sock ladies, Sue &
Peg, are nagging everyone to get moving so we don't miss the next control.
I head out with Ed and Mary. The next section is flat to rolling and favors
a tandem pace. Ed, Mary and I get a chance to catch up with how our day has
progressed since we rode together last night into Mazama.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We have a bit of wind and traffic, but a nice wide shoulder most of the way
into Granite Falls. Along the way we pick up Dan Wallace from Florida.
He rode the challenging Georgia 400K and finished with 10 minutes to spare.
Dan said the GA 400K was good preparation for the Cascade 1200K. As the
temperature drops, we're all in great spirits.
We're getting ready for the final leg.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Granite Falls - mile 741<BR>
6/27 21:00</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We have agreed to make Granite Falls a brief stop. There is only 21 miles left in the ride, but it will soon be dark and we like to eke out the remaining hour or so of twilight.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
After it gets dark I ride ahead of Dan and the tandem. We have a lot of
turns (14) over this short distance and my GPS provides an audible signal
even before the turn is visible. A crowd of people are cheering us as we
arrive at the motel lobby. The four of us arrive at the finish at 11:57 pm,
slightly an hour ahead of the closing time.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Monroe - mile 762 (Finish)<BR>
6/27 22:57</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We turn in our cards, eat pizza, and await the remaining riders. Ten
minutes, another cheer as more riders appear. By 11:40, Bill, Alan, Jeff,
and Michelle have arrived. Soon the only remaining riders are the four from
Florida. Where are they? I'm sitting with Ed and Mary waiting. My watch
buzzes: 12 midnight. "That's it.", I say, "It's over for them."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Then a cheer goes up. It's the Florida riders. My watch is fast by two minutes -- control times are based on the atomic clock. The last four riders have arrived with two minutes to spare. Now that's cutting it close!
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Post-Ride:</B>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The format of this event, with each day's ride starting approximately the
same time, tends to keep most of the riders close together, as evident from
the finish times, mostly in the 87-90 hour range.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
I think the overall abandon (DNF) rate was 30%, which sounds about right for
this kind of event. Despite the challenging conditions, all the Tennessee
riders completed the ride within the time limit. Special congratulations to
Mary Gersema, who finished her first 1200K (and a difficult one at that) on
the back of a tandem with Ed.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<I>The good:</I> Lantiseptic -- the miracle cream for adult incontinence and
bedsores works well as a saddle balm. I also liked the floating drop bag that this ride format provided. Rather than spread out my gear among 2-4 bags at different locations, I could pack everything in a single bag and choose what to carry on any given day.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<I>The bad:</I> I should have brought along a larger capacity Camelbak. The 50oz
bladder just doesn't hold enough fluid for these extreme temperatures. In
the grand scheme of things this was a minor issue.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<I>The ugly:</I> Long stretches of unremitting 100F temps with no shade.
Everything else held up pretty well. Sore posterior, with 3 minor saddle sores. Hands, feet, and knees okay. No finger numbness. Less sleep than I would have liked.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
There is some discussion about SIR hosting this ride once every four years,
similar to GRR and the Rocky Mountain 1200K, so I'm glad we took the
opportunity to ride it this year. I'm sorry we missed the original route
toward St. Helens, but maybe we'll get a chance in a future year.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The biggest and best kudos to the outstanding support staff who did
everything in their power to keep us on the road. We literally could not
have completed this ride without you guys. Thanks!
