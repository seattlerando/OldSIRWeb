The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.

<b>Special Instruction:</b>
<p>
<b>A motel room at the I-90 Inn (Ellensburg Control) will be available in Ellensburg with a possible bag drop (emphasis on possible).  Please indicate on your entry what your overnight intentions are ie, ride straight thru, stop at Leavenworth, stop somewhere else.  Very important ride hint: get water at Ohanapecosh for the White Pass climb, carry an extra bottle for Blewett climb out of Ellensburg and stop at Nason Creek for the Stevens Pass climb.  There will be no support at the top of the passes.</b>
<p>
Equipment needed: Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
The Brevet Organizer encourages a SIR club Jersey, RUSA Jersey or Randonneurs Mondiaux (PBP Jersey).  This helps the new folks and folks from out of town identify those with brevet experience.
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Mark has offered to provide folks a place to stay prior to the ride if needed.  Please contact Mark via the SIR web site to make arrangements.
<p>
<b>Bag Drop:</b> A motel room at the I-90 Inn (Ellensburg Control) will be available in Ellensburg with a possible bag drop (emphasis on possible). If there is a large rider turn out, we will try to reserve further room space (no guarantee).  A number of accommodations exist in Leavenworth if you would like a more personal situation. - <a href="http://www.leavenworthlodging.org/Lodging.htm" target="_blank">http://www.leavenworthlodging.org/Lodging.htm</a>.
<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Mark Thomas residence Food and Spirits available.  Family, Friends and Foes welcome.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> The route is new for this year.  The route will start from Mark Thomas's house about 4 miles north of Redmond.  We will follow E Lake Samamish to Issaquah and then to Hobart.  From Hobart, we will follow the 200k route to Enumclaw.  From Enumclaw we will use Hwy 410 and 123 to go over Cayuse Pass to the Junction of Hwy 12. Heading East on Hwy 12 from the junction of 123 and 12, we will go over White Pass almost into Yakima, BUT not quite.  Turning left (north) onto the Old Naches Hwy (just before the Big Iron Bridge) and following a few back streets you will arrive in Selah.  We will then take Hwy 821 through a beautiful canyon into Ellensburg.  From Ellensburg, we will use Hwy 97 to go over Blewett Pass to proceed to Leavenworth. Using US-2, we will head west over Stevens Pass to Sultan. From Sultan, we will make our way home using the backroads of Ben Howard, Tualco and W. Snoqualmie Valley Rds to Carnation. From Carnation we retrace about 7 miles (11k) before heading up and over Novelty Hill to return to the Thomas Residence. If you have been reading closely, you will have read that you have crossed over four mountain passes each over 4000'.
