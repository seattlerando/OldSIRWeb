<b>Route Description:</b> The route begins at the Fish Tail Brewpub in downtown Olympia. The route quickly escapes downtown with a short climb up from Capitol Lake and Tumwater hill and then heads south along the west shore of Black Lake and south-west through Capitol Forest. After the first control in Oakville, the route continues south on rolling rural roads through Curtis and Boisfort interspersed with a few nice climbs. The route reaches its southernmost point just outside Ryderwood and then flattens out heading east toward Vader and then north through Winlock, Chehalis, Centralia and back to Olympia. There are other places for food/water stops along the route besides the controls. These will be indicated on the final route sheet.</b>

<B>Pre-ride Notes:</B>
From Paul Johnson:<BR>
It was a great day for a ride and as I will be away next week I asked James if it would be alright if I rode along.  I was really surprised when I down loaded the route sheet to see so many familiar hills in the first  half of the ride.  There are no big rides, but lots of hills, a few steep (14%) so it should be great training for anyone considering PBP next year. For those of you who struggle with wasting too much time in the controls we have a solution: almost no controls! This is an enjoyable ride on back roads of Thurston, Grays Harbor, and Lewis counties, lots of hills and some of that famous south sound chip seal to keep you awake on the bike. If the weather is hot you might consider bringing your camel back or an extra bottle of water as there are a few long stretches between services.
<p>
From James Gutholm:<BR>
Be sure to have plenty of liquid, especially if it's a hot day. I carried 4 bottles most of the day and needed 3 of them even though it was relatively cool for mid July. There are not many controls but there are ample places to stop along the way, all marked on the cue sheet. The roads were spectacularly quiet for most of the route. The route flattens out at mile 110 for a quick run north to the finish but be prepared for the possibility of strong headwinds that are frequent this time of year. We got lucky and it was actually a pretty mild day.
