Per ACP mandate, all USA entrants must be members of Randonneurs USA and submit their entry via RUSA. RUSA members can enter PBP by sending the PBP entry form, payment and all other required documents to RUSA before July 1 (listing all successfully completed revets in sequence). RUSA collects and collates the forms, ensures they are correct, puts them in alphabetical order, sorts them into categories by start time and sends the forms to the ACP in France along with one large payment in Euros. Riders receive their PBP registration packet of information directly from the ACP around August 1.

<p align="left">
Once again, Terry Zmryal going to be running a Winter Rides Series. Pretty much the full details are on the SIR site and in the Cascade newsletter. It will be run a lot like last year. The first ride will be the weekend of January 11th and will lead up to the SIR 100K on March 1st and the SIR 200K on March 15th with distances varying from about 35 miles to 85 miles, always with shortcuts available. These rides will be a little hillier than in the past as preparation for Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP), but still very doable.

All distribution of information is via e-mail. If you'd like to receive weekly mails about the ride for the week contact Terry at <a href="mailto:terryz@microsoft.com">terryz@microsoft.com</a> to get on the list and feel free to forward this info to anyone else who may be interested.

This is going to be a busy year for SIR and all randonneurs around the world as we prepare for PBP. Because of all the brevets being run it would be great for SIR members to help out the brevet organizers. There's lots to do and any help provided will help make it all go smoother!
<p>
<b>Fenders</b>...everyone must have them...there is no penalty and your friends will still be friends when the ride is over. Some say that they weigh too much, but there are far better places to save weight (wheels, body fat, wet chamiox from having no fenders). Some say they can't fit them to their frame, but that's an illusion (there are no bikes that some form of fenders can't fit. If I can get a pair on my Match Paramount, it can be done!) Some say it causes an aerodynamic disadvantage; well, if that's the case shouldn't you be riding in Europe with USPS and getting paid?? This is the time of year (now through July) when fenders are your best defense in keeping dry, happy and in great spirits as your SIR friendships deepen.
