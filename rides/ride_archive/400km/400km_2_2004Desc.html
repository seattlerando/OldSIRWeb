<b>Route Description:</b> A reprise of Ken Carter's famed 2001 "South Cascade Passes" route - back by popular acclaim.  This is a spectacular route with widely varied terrain and lots of climbing.  Training from previous brevets over Mountain Passes is the best experience to determine if you are prepared for this course. The route includes three South Cascade Passes; White Pass (4500'), Chinook Pass (5430') and Cayuse Pass (4675').  From the King's Motel we follow the RAMROD course to within ten miles of the Rainier National Park entrance, then take idyllic Skate Creek Road to Packwood, head East on Hwy 12 up and over White Pass, followed by an exhilarating descent to Rimrock Lake & gentle downhill grades to Hwy 410.  At the "T" we cross onto Old Naches Hwy for a brief meander through orchards to Naches, then continue on US-12 to Yakima.  After returning on US-12 to Hwy 410, we proceed through Cliffdell then up the steeper grades to Chinook Pass (SIR support greets you at the rest area).  From the summit there is a fast descent with switchbacks to Cayuse Pass, then another long descent to Crystal Mtn Blvd where the road widens and smoothes out through the valley to Enumclaw.  There are no services open at night between Cayuse Pass and Enumclaw.
