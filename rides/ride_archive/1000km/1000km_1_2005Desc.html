<b>Special Instructions:</b>
<p>
Please read the <A HREF="http://www.cascade1200.com/faqs.html">FAQs for the Cascade 1200 km</A>. 
<p>
<b> Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
