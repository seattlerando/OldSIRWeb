Gold Rush Randonnée -- 1200 km Randonnée in California Next July<br><br>

<img align=left border=0 src="GRRLogo.jpg"><font size=3 color=navy>
The Davis Bike Club extends a hearty invitation to our SIR randonneuring
colleagues to do the first Gold Rush Randonnée on July 9-11th. The GRR
route is a mixture of high mountains and flat farmlands, all of it on
scenic roads in some of California's last unspoiled regions. Standard
randonneuring regulations and format will be used, namely 90 hours to do
the 1200 kilometers. Riders will need to do the normal Super Randonneur
series of four brevets in spring of 2001 for automatic entry into the
GRR--but they should contact us if their regional 600 km brevet occurs too
late for this. The controls are spaced every 80-100 kilometers and will
have full support by the Davis Bike Club. The club is working with a
travel agent to arrange travel packages for entrants travelling long
distances to Davis. There will also be various tourist excursions during
the ride itself for spouses and their children while the rider in the
family does the GRR. Since Davis is centrally located in the northern
part of the state, many popular tourist regions such as San Francisco,
Yosemite National Park, Lake Tahoe, or the Napa Valley wine-growing
region are all accessible for vacations before or after the event. For
further information, write to:

Mark's speech to the Redmond City Council - January 16, 2001<br><br>

<font size=3 color=navy>
<p>Mayor Ives, members of the city council, I'm Mark Thomas and I'm here tonight on behalf 
of the League of American Bicyclists to recognize Redmond for its support of bicycling.<br><br>
The League of American Bicyclists is the nation's premier cycling organization, with a current 
membership of 300,000 affiliated cyclists, including 40,000 individuals and 600 organizations. 
The League promotes bicycling for fun, fitness and transportation, and works through advocacy 
and education for a bicycle-friendly America. The League represents the interests of the 
nation's 42.4 million bicyclists.<br><br>

Tonight I'm pleased to announce that the League has awarded Redmond its designation as 
a "<i>Bicycle-Friendly Community</i>." This designation is memorialized in this plaque, 
which I am pleased on behalf of the League of American Bicyclists to present to the city. 
Redmond joins 50 other communities nationwide that have been recognized by the League 
for actively supporting local cycling and for meeting the League's established criteria for 
bicycle infrastructure and promotion of cycling. <br><br>

By this award, the League applauds the many accomplishments of the Pedestrian and Bicycle 
Advisory Committee and the City staff as they work to improve cycling in Redmond.  In 
reviewing this application three items were particularly important to the League.<br><br>

 –	First was the creation of a subsection of the Redmond Comprehensive Plan outlining 
the Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan for the city.<br><br>

 –	Second, was the commitment by Redmond of $700,000 to fund bicycle facilities 
improvements between 1999 and 2004.<br><br>

 –	Third, and most important was the positive feedback the League has received from 
individuals who cycle in Redmond on a regular basis.<br><br>

The League believes that, in many ways, this designation is a metaphor for distinguishing a 
community as a good place to live and work. It recognizes that the community takes care of 
its citizens by providing excellent facilities and resources to support bicycling for transportation 
and recreation. Being friendly to bicycling enhances the attractiveness of Redmond to its 
residents, its employers, and its potential employers.<br><br>

I can personally heartily second the League's recognition of Redmond.<br><br>

~ As an avid recreational cyclist and president of the Seattle International Randonneurs, 
a local bicycling club devoted to long distance cycling, I have found Redmond to be a 
"<i>Bicycle-Friendly Community</i>" in which to ride for fun.<br><br>

~ As the owners of Sammamish Valley Cycle in Redmond, my wife and I have found 
Redmond to be a "<i>Bicycle-Friendly Community</i>" in which to do business.<br><br>

~ As a bicycle commuter who has often used the streets and trails of this city to get to 
work, I have found Redmond to be a "<i>Bicycle-Friendly Community</i>" for bicycle 
alternatives to car commuting.<br><br>

~ And as parents of two cycling children who use the trails and bike lanes of Redmond 
to visit friends, shop, see movies, and achieve an important degree of independence 
and self-reliance, my wife and I have emphatically found Redmond to be a "
<i>Bicycle-Friendly Community</i>" in which to live and raise a family.<br><br>

So I join the League of American Bicyclists in recognizing the excellent work that has 
been done in Redmond for cyclists and also in encouraging continued improvements in and 
attention to this important aspect of life in Redmond.  Every community has numerous areas 
in which citizens, local businesses, and local government can work together to become more 
bicycle-friendly. Congratulations and keep up the good work.
