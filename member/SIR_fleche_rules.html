<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Fl&#232;che is a 24 hour, team event, of at least 360 KM in
distance and run similar to a brevet. Each team plans its own route
with a common destination in mind. The Fl&#232;che is a fun event fostering
friendships, teamwork and camaraderie during the planning, riding and finishing
celebration of the accomplishment. Here is some background on the
French Fl&#232;che V&#233;locio event, Seattle International Randonneurs
(SIR) adoption of the Fl&#232;che V&#233;locio rules and how SIR runs
its Fl&#232;che.

The Fl&#232;che V&#233;locio is a creation of the
French. Each Easter weekend randonneuring clubs around France ride
in small teams from their respective towns to converge at a designated
location in the south of France. The Fl&#232;che (arrow) equates to arrows
to a target. Family members generally precede the team's arrival
on Easter then hold a communal celebration. Rules are few but important.
Randonneuring clubs around the world participate in national Fl&#232;ches on
the same weekend. Clubs in the northern climates are granted a one
month extension from the traditional Easter date due to harsher weather.

<a name="Rules"></a><b>Fl&#232;che NW Rules</b>

<UL>
	<LI>The Fl&#232;che NW is a 24 hour Randonn&#233;e and is organized and administered by Seattle International Randonneurs (SIR).</LI>

	<LI>The Randonn&#233;e is limited to teams of riders. Each team is limited to a maximum of 5 members and a minimum of 3 members. Tandems, mixed or otherwise, count as a single member. Note...a member equates to a bicycle.</LI>

	<LI>The purpose of the Fl&#232;che NW, in the spirit of randonneuring, is to promote teamwork, camaraderie and synergy of purpose. The goal for each team is to complete their stated objective, enjoy the journey and celebrate their accomplishment of this early season event.</LI>

	<LI>No licensed professional riders regardless of affiliation are permitted. An exception will be made for veterans class riders more than 50 years old.</LI>

	<LI>Distance traveled is calculated on the basis of the shortest route between checkpoints. Maps will be used to determine distances. In the case of forced detours due to road construction, accidents, etc., only the additional mileage verified by a independent 3rd party signature or stamp with time and location at the far point of the detour will be counted. Further, such mileage will be counted only if shown on the maps.</LI>

	<LI>Routes may not use the same road twice in the same direction.</LI>

	<LI>Members of the same team may assist one another; however, teams are expressly forbidden to aid each other.</LI>

	<LI>Assistance from non-participants or from support vehicles following riders is also not permitted. There may be secret and roving checkpoints. The decisions of all officials are final. Those violating the rules will be notified immediately and their route cards will be marked accordingly. Any team using a following, support vehicle in any way or at any time will be disqualified and the team's club will be suspended from participating in the Fl&#232;che NW the following year.</LI>

	<LI>This is a Randonn&#233;e, not a race. Each participant is considered to be on a solo ride and is responsible for any accidents caused by or suffered by the same. Riders must be civil at all times, they must abide by all applicable traffic laws, and they must follow the directions of all law enforcement personnel.</LI>

	<LI>No advertising of any sort is allowed on the rider's jersey, jacket, shorts, helmet, etc.</LI>

	<LI>Only human powered vehicles are allowed. All vehicles must be equipped with functional lights. Roving checkpoint officials can and will confiscate the route card of any rider riding without lights. Lights must be firmly affixed to the vehicle and be of sufficient wattage. Riding in a group does not change the lighting requirement. All riders must use their lights.</LI>

	<LI>Light colored clothing and reflective vests, ankle, and arm bands are strongly recommended. Fenders are also strongly recommended.</LI>

	<LI>The minimum distance required for the 24 hour period is 360 km. Riders may start their rides from 9:00 AM on Friday to 9:00 AM on Saturday.</LI>

	<LI>All Fl&#232;che NW team members must sign the SIR insurance form prior to starting the Fl&#232;che.</LI>

<b>To Register for the Fl&#232;che NW teams must:</b>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Submit a detailed route with controls, list all team members and not more than 2 alternates, indicate the team leader and team name after January 1 and postmarked by April 1st, 2005. (Submissions arriving after this date will not be considered and will be returned to the sender.) Upon receipt and approval of their proposed route, the team will receive final registration documentation. To speed up the approval process, please provide full details on the proposed
route, i.e. copy of the map used with route marked using a yellow hi-liter, control locations, town names, total mileage, as well as both partial and cumulative mileage. SIR will keep each teams membership and route confidential.

<p>2. For planning purposes consider the likelihood of the distance being greater than the proposed route. However, distances 15% greater than that of the proposed route cannot be certified. Similarly, distances 20% less than that of the proposed route will result in disqualification.

<p>3. Submit your entry fee with your route and controls. If a team withdraws prior to the start a administrative fee may be deducted from the returned entry fee.

<p><b>Before the Start:</b><br>
Each team member must have in their position their route card listing the names of the controls and the approximate time of arrival in each in the spaces provided on the card. At the start, the time
and place must be noted on the route card. This must be done by a independent 3rd party i.e. a gas station, general store or a business.

<p>The start time and starting place approved by SIR at registration must be used. SIR officials may be on hand to officially supervise the start. All team members must have their route cards in their
possession at all times and must present their route cards to all officials making such a demand.

<p><b>Attention!</b><br>
At the end of the 22nd hour of the ride, the exact time and the location of the team must be noted on each route card and verified by the signature and stamp of a local merchant, official, etc. Lack of the 22nd hour checkpoint verification will result in disqualification. All route cards must indicate the time and location of this verification. Failure to follow this requirement will result in disqualification.

<p><b>At the Finish:</b><br>
Teams must have their location and time verified at the nearest town or village at the end of their 24 hours. Verification must be via a stamp and a signature obtained at a place of business, a
police station, or at a train/bus station. The exact time and location must be noted on the route cards as well as the mileage completed. A lost route card or missing signatures will result in the automatic disqualification of the team member(s).

<p><b>Certification:</b><br>
For your Fl&#232;che NW to be registered with Audax Club Parisien and the results counted toward team awards:
<ul>
<li>at least 3 team riders must be a member in good standing with a recognized randonneuring club.</li>

<li>at least 3 team members must have ridden the entire distance (same mileage.)</li>

<li>at least 25 KM must have been ridden between the end of the 22nd hour and the end of the 24th hour of the ride. Under no circumstances may these two checkpoints be the same place, even if the planned distance has already be completed.</li>

<li>at least 3 team members must be present at the awards banquet on Sunday and have presented the team's route cards to SIR officials between 8:00 AM and 9:30 AM that day. (Note: a membber equals a bicycle).</li>

<li>
team riders not arriving with the team but who have met the 360 KM requirement, as well as, the 25 KM requirement between the end of the 22nd and 24th hour will be certified as individuals, but their result will nor figure in the attribution of team awards, nor will it count for the Randonneurs 5000 award.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Fl&#232;che NW commission will handle all complaints or questions. These must be submitted in writing within 72 hours of the finish to the SIR official responsible for the Fl&#232;che NW.

<p>Commission address: To be announced prior to the Fl&#232;che NW start date.

<p>SIR reserves the right to change at any time the requirements set out herein.

<p>The registration fee: To be announced along with the finishing destination.

<p>The registration fee must be included with each registration. Checks should be made payable to SIR and sent to the SIR official in charge of the Fl&#232;che NW. A self addressed stamped envelope
should also be included with registration.

<p>If several teams use the same starting point, then starts for individual teams shall be spaced one hour apart. Choice of routes and starting times will be assigned by SIR according to the order of receipt of registrations.

<p>Teams wishing to receive support at two or a maximum of three points during the ride must indicate such support at the time of registration and must indicate in detail the locations where support will
be received.

<p>Prior to the start, should circumstances beyond the control of team members force a change in the makeup of the team with previously registered alternates, SIR's Fl&#232;che NW official must be notified immediately. A follow-up letter confirming any such change must also be sent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>

<a name="FD"></a><b>Select a Fl&#232;che date and solicit a Fl&#232;che
organizer/administrator</b>
<br>Easter weekend is the standard Fl&#232;che weekend.
Up to a one month reprieve is granted to locations in the northern climate.
The Fl&#232;che date should be submitted in the preceding fall to the actual
event date, with the regular brevet dates, to be recognized and placed
on the international schedule of events.

<p>The Fl&#232;che organizer/administrator (FOA) should be familiar
with the requirements of organizing and running a brevet. The FOA
may also participate as a team member (see caveat* later on.)

<p><a name="FFD"></a><b>Select a finishing destination</b>
<br>Ideally the finishing destination should provide: varied
and safe riding venues, good accessibility, a reasonably priced banquet
facility with private space and cleanup/overnight accommodations nearby.
Wenatchee has been used successfully and is viable to teams coming from
Portland. OR.

<p><a name="AF"></a><b>Announce the Fl&#232;che, requesting teams
to form and apply</b>
<br>After the event destination is selected decide on what
awards will be offered and how much to charge for the event entry fee.
Entry fee can be per team or per team member and should cover all event
expenses. A few examples for awards are: the team that completes
the most miles (can promote rivalries,) the team coming the closet to a
selected target distance i.e. 365 kilometers (can be a real challenge with
planned vs. actual ridden distance,) team or person who traveled from the
furthest location.

<p>Send out a notice announcing the finish destination, rules,
awards, dates and asking for teams to form and a team leader to be selected.
Event communication will be with each teams leader. Dates include:
date for the Fl&#232;che and a deadline for submitting proposed routes.
Allowing adequate time for teams to form, plan and submit routes.
This activity should commence early January.

<p><a name="FP"></a><b>Send out team instructions and rules
packet</b>
<br>After teams have been identified, send each team leader
a route planning packet. This includes a Washington Department of
Transportation road map - available at Washington State Patrol offices,
route worksheet, copy of Fl&#232;che NW rules and any other useful information
i.e. address of finish/banquet facility. Each team must design their
own route using the map and worksheet with the finish destination in mind.
Each teams route must be verifiable from maps and conform to standard
randonneuring rules. The one exception is that control time limits
are omitted. The teams route must be traced (a yellow marker works)
on the map. If roads are used not shown the supplied maps than a
supplemental map detailing these sections must be supplied. The worksheet
must list each control and distance from the previous control. Additional
information noted on the work sheet is which if any controls the team plans
for outside support, a team name or "handle," the full name of each team
member, team caption plus any alternate team members. Once this information
is submitted to the FOA only listed alternates can be substituted for original
team members. The completed worksheet, annotated map and any clarifications
are then returned to the FOA for verification. The teams route planning
session provides an excellent opportunity to hold a potluck, share experiences
and build camaraderie.

<p><a name="RE"></a><b>Review each teams proposed route
and negotiate changes if necessary</b>
<br>The FOA reviews each teams worksheets for accuracy.
Distances listed on the worksheet must be picked up and calculated correctly
from the map. The sum of the individual leg distances must equal
the total distance stated. All controls must list and define the
outer limits of the route where shorter routes exist. Any outside
support at controls must be noted. After resolving any discrepancies
with the team leader and then prepare the teams control cards.

<p><a name="CC"></a><b>Prepare and send out control cards</b>
<br>Prepare one control card for each team member.
The card contains the team name, team members name, start location and
time, each control, its distance from the previous control, running total
from the start, a box for the 22 hour control and a finish control box
for riders signature and total distance ridden. Send the control
cards plus a couple of extra cards with no names should an alternate be
used, to the team leader. Each teams plan is strictly confidential*
and not to be discussed. This adds to the mystique of who is doing
what and where.

<p><a name="ME"></a><b>Monitor event progress on day of
ride</b>
<br>If the FOA is not participating on a team then checking
on the teams progress on ride day is advisable. The FOA may administer
one or more secret controls on any route. If the FOA accepts this
responsibility they should plan to be at the finish when the first team
finishes. With each team selecting its own starting time then finishing
24 hours later, the finish can vary wildly. Starting strategies run
the gamut from Friday evening, getting the night riding over first to starting
Saturday after a good nights sleep and everything in-between.

<p><a name="PR"></a><b>At the finish, process results</b>
<br>Each teams control cards are collected as they finish
and checked for all the required control signatures, especially the 22
hour rule -- see rules for an explanation. To receive credit towards
Super Randonneur 5000 at least 3 team riders must have ridden the entire
distance that must be at least 360 KM.

<p><a name="BQ"></a><b>Hold banquet and announce results and awards</b>
<br>Allow enough time for people clean up before starting
the banquet festivities, a buffet brunch works. After replenishing
calories start by introducing each team by name, its members and any support
people. Encourag participants to comment on their 24 hour experience.
Lastly announce the distance covered for each team, present any awards
and enjoy the camaraderie and stories.
