<img align=left border=0 src="bullet.jpg">Monday, July 31, 2000
<br><br>Hi Everyone,
<br><br>It's been a month since RAAM and I have finally got all my thoughts about me. 
What a race! I have often asked myself how in the **** I hit a cow , but I guess you 
had to be there to see it with your own eyes! The area reminded me of being in Death 
Valley in the middle of the night; Pitch black with no lights from towns to interfere. 
I was very fortunate that I was only doing 35mph and not 50+mph as I was doing just a 
few minutes before (I stopped to put some more clothes on - 35 degrees and gusty). 

<br><br><img align=right border=0 src="bajema.jpg">
Well that was only the icing on the cake as my race included a unwanted friend 
we all have on occasion called Murphy. He, or maybe she is very quiet but lets you know 
their presence with subtle hints, ha ha!. It all started a day before the race with my 
mechanic / masseuses pulling out ..... leaving me with very little experience and more 
importantly a member short! I did not think much of it as what else could happen ... we 
were going to have a smooth trip with minimal problems... and my crew is very resourceful. 
On the trip down to Portland, I met up with my motorhome just outside Olympia WA. and 
found it had no rear lights and it is dark out, go figure! Well thank goodness for the 
RAAM electrician who donated his time to assist us in need... he spent a total of 3hrs 
on the motorhome getting my marking lights and backup light working. A big thanks goes 
out to the gentleman whose name has slipped me. Thinking that all my problems are behind 
me, the race starts off successfully. I am feeling great, the hills in Oregon are coming 
and going with little effort. About four hours into the ride my motorhome passes me honking 
and giving me the thumbs up. little did I know this would be the last time I would see the 
motorhome running for the entire race. Within a hrs time I see what looks like a motorhome 
dead on the wrong side of the street. As I approach it one of my crew members comes out and 
yells at me " don't worry Pete, we'll get it fixed and catch up with you". That was the 
last time I saw the motorhome. It eventually got towed back to Madras OR and had the burnt 
valve replaced. Meanwhile I continued to ride with a crew that has suddenly dwindled down 
to three and only one with crewing experience. For the next 2 1/2 days we got by with the 
(3) member crew team. What makes it even more impressive is I went down to sleep for three 
hours total during that time. The only thing that went array during this time was during 
the first night setting up my light system on my spare bike. Instead of going ahead a mile 
or two, they went ahead several, and by the time I reached them it was dark and I was being 
escorted by the race officials (Thanks Rob and company!). I think they "over estimated my 
time by a factor or two! 
<br><br>
<img align=left border=0 src="PeteRAAM.jpg">
When the Motorhome crew determined it was going to be a while before the motorhome was fixed, 
they started looking for a rental vehicle, i.e.. a van... but with our luck the closest one 
was back in Portland. So they rented two vehicles, a Blazer and full-size truck loaded them 
up and chased after me. We all finally met up in some small town in Utah. What a relief for 
the crew in the van! I even met up with the motorhome owner in his other motorhome heading 
home. I should have been more firm in giving us his motorhome, but after a little thought he 
decided against it. Well at least I had a fresh crew and new found enthusiasm with all my 
crew finally together. I cruised through the first half of Utah and decided to take it easy 
up the 30 mile climb over the Monte Cristo Mt. range. It was long and in some parts tough, 
but I left myself in good shape at the top, feeling fresh and ready to ride through the night. 
This was all short lived as I coming down the pass(~midnight) when I met a large black object 
that went moo...One thing I found out was there was not much give in one of these animals, 
it was just like hitting a brick wall! All I saw of this black beast was a white nose and 
two beady red eyes staring at me as it came into my line of site. That site will forever be 
etched into my memory, as I just had time to get one hand out the aerobars and into the brake 
hood before impact. Fortunately for me I startled the cow when I hit it, causing it to run 
over the other side of the road and down the embankment. This redirected my travel to the 
small gully just off the right side of the road. Amazingly I didn't hit the road and landed 
about 15 -20 ft down on to some sagebrush and small rocks. Unfortunately I was not able to 
move my right side so the ambulance was called. They arrived ~ one hour later put me on a 
backboard and transported me 40 miles to the Hospital in Evanston, Wyoming. Once I got to 
the hospital feeling started to come back to the ride side (what a relief) but the knees, 
left quad and right thumb were another story. All were starting to really hurt when they 
gave me this pain killer which instantly cleared the pain! The doctor advised me to take 
a sleep break and see how I felt in the morning. Well that was not a problem as the drugs 
they gave me knocked me out within minutes of the reaching the hotel room.

<br><br>After three hours of rest, I woke up to a stiff body! Bound and determined to get 
back on the bike, I spend the next hr stretching and getting rubbed down. By the time I got 

back to the location of the accident , I was ready to ride. The miles into Woodruff and 
Evanston WY. were flat and fast. As I started to climb out of Evanston, my knees started 
to really hurt. Hoping it was a just a phase, I pedaled on. That was the best my knees felt 
for the rest of my race. By the time I crossed the Colorado border my knees were in constant 
pain. I went down for a 90 minute sleep break in Dinosaur CO out in a chase Lounge. When I 
woke up my whole right side was paralyzed and not functioning. Off in the van back to Vernal 
UT and a 30 minute Jacuzzi to hopefully get me moving. Once again it worked, and I was off 
to Dinosaur to start riding again. The Next stretch to Craig CO would let me know if I could 
continue to race as it had ~4000ft of climbing in it. Everything was going great till the 
first hill; Only the pain was worse. I kept riding till the next bit of climbing when my 
knees made a couple of painful popping sounds (felt like someone was hit me with a 2x4 
every revolution). I got off the bike and was driven 90 minutes to the hospital in 
Steamboat Spring, CO. (Known for its good sports doctors). I spent the next six hours 
getting x-rayed, poked and prodded. They mad a custom splint for my thumb and told me that 
rest off the bike is what I needed... We decided to take a two hour break and see how I felt. 
The two hours came and went I was not feeling much better... but decided to give it one 
more go as I was not out of finishing under the allotted time yet. We drove back the 
stopping point and off I went. I probably should have turned it in at the hospital as it 
was no better than before. I limped into Craig CO. not able to control the knee swelling/
pain and called it quits...

<br><br>I decided to drive the rest of the course and see what I missed (for future races - 
so keep this wonderful course!!!!) with part of my crew. One by one we picked of each of 
the riders finally catching up to Wolfgang somewhere in Arkansas. What was amazing about 
Wolfgang is that he looked so fresh for being on the bike so long! He is quite a rider.... 
Up ahead was the 2-man team of Bishop and Maida, looking strong but tired. It was like 
yesterday when I saw them pass me in Idaho. We arrived in Gulf Breeze the night before 
the first riders finished to overcast skies... it reminded me of the weather back in the 
Pacific northwest just a bit warmer. Sure enough, the rains came later that night and 
continued through the morning hours. What a finish... crossing a four mile bridge with 
nothing but beautiful blue water around you (traffic too!). We stayed to cheer on the 
riders who came in the first two days and the banquet to celebrate everyone's 
accomplishments. Lon, Susan and company, what a wonderful job you all did in putting 
together this event! As long as you are at the helm next year I will be back to finish, 
minus a cow!

<br><br>PS: A special word for Tom Buckley. You are a man after my own heart when you 
asked for that chair on stage after the finish! Good job!

<p>It's a nearly 6 on Saturday morning on my way to Mark's.  Crossing the Sammamish 
Valley I see something bright ahead.  It's Kent Peterson entering 124th
Avenue NE from the River Trail.  He is lit up with lights and reflectors everywhere.</p>

<p>Wayne Methner organized this last-of-the-season brevet in the Audax style.  We intended 
to average 25-30 Kph.  A few of us slowed the group to a 20 Kph average.  But, we had fun!
Early in the ride we rode as a group.  Later, people went their own pace regrouping several 
times along the route.  Somewhere after 200 km, and before the finish, we climbed this hill.
This hill - most climbed on their bicycles - a few walked.  It was steep!

<p>After the ride, Chris Thomas feed us with a magnificant spread to celebrate Mark's 40th 
birthday.

<p>The weather was dry and by mid-day very warm.  See Kent's weather report (below).  

<p><b>Report from Kent Peterson</b></p>

<p>OK, this is WAY over the edge in nerdiness, but I dumped the info from my
iButton Chronotherm (tm)for Saturday's 200 km ride. This little gadget, which 
is about the size of five dimes, was sitting in my Camelbak and logging the 
temperature every ten minutes. Bottom line, it got down to 40 degrees
for that section up on the Issaquah Plateau but it was even colder for my
ride up to Mark's house. It took us almost until 2:00 PM to hit 70 degrees.</p>

<p><center><b>2000 General Meeting</b></center></p>

<p>SIR held its general meeting on October 21, 2000.  Again this year, 
Hales Ales Pub in Ballard was our venue.  
Lasagna, beer, and good cheer were shared by many SIR members.<br><br>

During the meeting, RBA Mark Thomas handed out brevet medals and cards, and 
Flèche Northwest and Flèche Pacifique certificates.  
The medals for the 200 km and 1000 km will be mailed upon receipt. 
2000 brevet volunteers were recognized and given a gift.
Pete "brahmabullet" Bajema was honored for distinquishing himself in RAAM 2000.  In his absence,
he was awarded with the soft friendly cow, complete with sounding cow bell.<br><br>

We announced the 2001 brevet schedule, including selecting the brevet organizers.
2001 officers were elected. Mark Thomas (RBA) and Ken Carter (Treasurer) 
volunteered for another year of service.  
Peter McKay (Newsletter Editor) was elected.<br><br>

Mark opened the general business session with a motion to affilate SIR with ACP.  
The motion was seconded by many, and enthusiascticaly approved.

In other business, we discussed brevet fees and the level of brevet support.  
Brevet fees for the 400 and 600 were increased during the last executive meeting.  
Brevet support varies among the various randonneuring clubs.  
It was agreed that our support is adequate for our club.

Ken Carter led a general discussion of club finances. A suggestion to use club 
funds to defray costs of participating in PBP 2003 was deferred.<br><br>

Thanks to Mark and Bill for a great meeting.  
Thanks also to Mark, Ken and Kent for their service as club officers in 2000.

Note from Terry:<br><br>
For those of you interested in the 2001 Seattle 1000 km, I am the brevet
organizer. I may create a new route. Two options I'm consider are a loop
through the Olympic Peninsula down to Astoria and back or a North
Cascades/Stevens loop with several hundred miles in eastern Washington. If
you are considerng riding it and have any preferences or ideas for routes,
please let me know. Thanks - TerryZ

<p><center><font=3><b>RUSA 1000 km & 2000km Medals - Reminder</b></f></center></p>

<p>Applications for the RUSA 1000 km and 2000km medals are due December 1, 2000!!!<br><br>  

These medals signify participation in brevets sponsored by RUSA member clubs. 
The awards are for any RUSA event participant who compiles 1000 or 2000 kilometers 
of brevets in one calendar year.
Riders must complete the brevets between January and October. 
The custom-designed medals will cost $7 each, and be awarded at the end of the year. 
One brevet may not count toward both medals. 
To earn both medals, the randonneur must ride 3000k in brevets during the calendar year. 
For the rider who is not interested in the longer brevets, 
this is a great way to see different regions of the US. 
You could earn both medals by travelling to various regions and doing 200 km rides. 
What a wonderful way to see the country, meet other randonneurs, and support our RBAs.
These are domestic medals and may be ordered in addition to the traditional 
French brevet medals.<br><br>

<font size="3">
<p><center><b>S2S Results</b><br>
July 8, 2000<br>
Reported by Pat Marek</center></p>

<p>There were 11 starters on 10 cycles. 7 riders finished
(elapsed times shown):<br>
<br>1. 16:04 <b>Jan Heine</b> and Allen Larsen (rode together)
<br>3. 16:39 Paul Binford and <b>Andy Fuller</b> (tandem, new record)
<br>4. 19:43 Brian Houser
<br>5. 19:55 <b>Kent Peterson</b> (fixed gear)
<br>6. 21:55 John Hunt
<br>DNF Coulee City <b>Lee Kanning</b>
<br>DNF Coulee City <b>Lynn Vigesaa</b>
<br>DNF Coulee City <b>Ron Lee</b>
<br>DNF Skykomish(?) Steve Wolfe</p>

<p>Conditions were mild, with no precipitation. Temperatures were
slightly higher than forecast in eastern Washington, with highs
in the mid-80's. It was mostly sunny, with more clouds closer to
Spokane. There were good westerlies on much of the route, though
there were also the usual crosswinds at times between Waterville
and Spokane.</p>

<p>The competition at the front turned into a repeat of
Cannonball, with <b>Jan</b> and Allen, who started the ride unsupported,
taking the lead from the tandem in eastern Washington and
managing to stay away to the finish. On Cannonball it was Allen
who experienced flat trouble, with four punctures, but this time
Jan had problems. After having finished 4 previous S2S rides
without a single flat, Jan had his first sew-up flat shortly
after the start. Two more followed, exhausting Jan's supply of
spares and forcing him to stop to pump up his rear tire every
3-to-4 miles. I found them at a gas station in Wilbur (over 60
miles from the finish), with Jan about to throw in the towel. He
had tried an automobile flat fixer compound, but it just squirted
out the leak in his sew-up. I had my Bianchi cyclo-cross racing
bike with me, so he asked to try out my rear wheel. He borrowed
my front wheel at the next stop so that they would both be riding
clinchers in the event of another flat. It worked, and got him to
Spokane with Allen. The tandem had closed the gap to 6 miles at
Wilbur, but could get no closer after that. Paul and <b>Andy</b> rolled
into the Cedar Village 35 minutes after Jan and Allen.
Considering that Andy had ridden the 600 km just one week before,
it was a very good team effort, and set a new tandem record. It
was also the first all-male tandem team to do S2S.</p>

<p>The next rider in was Brian Houser, an EWU professor from
Cheney, who started the ride very strongly. He was the first
rider up Stevens Pass. He hooked up with the tandem on the
descent to Leavenworth, and stayed with them most of the way to
Coulee City. He was riding unsupported, out to avenge a DNF from
the '99 ride. His stomach went south at Coulee City, turning the
ride into a real grind for him. He came in at 9:43 pm (19:43 ET),
after calling me from a supermarket phone to borrow a headlight
for the last few miles.</p>

<p><b>Kent Peterson</b> came in next, at 9:55 pm (19:55 ET). He became
the first person to do S2S on a fixed gear, riding a 70-incher
all day, and looked pretty fresh at the finish. After doing the
600 km on a fixed gear, he said that S2S was not such a big
challenge. In addition, he rode unsupported! 
<font color=magenta><b><i>(Editor: We expect no less from the Energizer Bunny.)
</i></b></font color> His ascent of the
Orondo Grade brought back memories of Dan Wood beating it into
submission on his single-speed adult BMX bike.</p>

<p>The final rider in was John Hunt, a first-time S2S rider who
was being supported by his wife and son. Their care and
encouragement helped him to keep on pedaling to the finish, which
was quite an achievement for a first-time rider who was
unfamiliar with the route.</p>

<p><b>Special Instructions:</b></p>

<p><b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for 
inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water 
for yourself. Please see "Expectations" section of 
the SIR Web site for further information.
</p>
<p>For this 200 km the following equipment is 
REQUIRED as we will start before daylight:
</p>
<p>Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards 
to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors 
are required. Note that many taillights are also 
legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders 
disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights 
must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be 
operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking 
taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
</p>
<p>Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding 
at night or during poor visibility. This is for 
your safety and others in the group. 
</p>
<p>Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.</p> 

<p>The Fall Season is upon again folks, so as a polite reminder 
and courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front 
wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional 
rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
</p>
<p>The Brevet Organizer encourages a club Jersey 
or Randonneurs Mondiaux (PBP Jersey).</p> 
 
<p>There will be a post-ride social at the Mark Thomas 
residence. Food and Spirits
will be available. Friends, foes and families 
are invited as well as the riders.</p>

<p><b>Route Description:</b></p>

<p>The Brevet Organizer is strongly encouraging an Audax 
style ride to end this wonderful riding year.  </p>

<p>The Audax Club Parisien was founded in November of 
1904. From 1905 on, the ACP organized the Brevets d'Audax, 
brought back from Italy by Henri Desgranges, head of 
l'Auto (a sports magazine). These consisted of doing 200 KM 
between dawn and dusk at an average speed of 18 KPH, as 
a group with a ride leader. Strict adherence to the 
pace was required.  
</p>
<p>My idea is to ride at about 25-30Kph (flat-no wind) 
and average about 20Kph.  Of course, I cannot require 
this style of riding, however, I thought it might be 
nice to honor an old tradition (Kent, you might 
put on a 42x18)  And next year, you just might 
see  a series of 200 km rides trying to 
honor this tradition.
</p>
<p>This fall 200 km follows many familiar roads.  
We will start just north of Redmond (at Mark 
Thomas' house) following SR-202 into Redmond. 
Then head south to Issaquah along E. Lake 
Sammamish Pkwy.  We will then head over the 
hill towards Fall City (but not quite) 
and into Carnation. From Carnation we will 
head to Sultan via West Snoqualmie Valley 
Rd and the Ben Howard Rd.  Leaving Sultan, 
we head to Granite Falls, seeing that 
steep little hill Mark Thomas found this 
year and, of course, Lake Roesiger.  The 
only way to get from Granite Falls to 
Arlington is to use Burn Rd.  From Arlington 
we jet to Snohomish via SR-9.  Then we switch 
to the backroads of Broadway, Paradise Lake 
and Avondale back to Mark's.

<center><b>SIR 300 km</b></center>

<br>
<br>
 
<center>May 13, 2000</center>

<br>
<br>
 

<center>by Kent Peterson</center>

<br>
<br>

<p>I wake up at 2:57 AM. I've always had an ability to wake up pretty
much on cue but today was the SIR 300 km brevet, so I'd set an alarm just
to be extra sure. My friend Andy is coming by to pick me up at 4:00 AM.
We'll load my bike next to his on the back of his SUV and drive up to
Mulkilteo. But I still have three minutes before my alarm will go off
so I curl up to enjoy those extra three minutes.</p>

<p>When I wake up again, it is 3:58 AM. Damn, Damn, Damn, Damn, Damn! 
I slept right through the alarm! As fate would have it my wife is down in
Portland for the weekend so nobody is around to poke me into paying
attention to the alarm.
Oh well, Andy's never on time, right?</p>

<p>It is possible to go to the bathroom and put on a full set of bike
clothes in three minutes. I know this because Andy picks today to be
almost perfectly punctual and he rolls into my driveway at 4:01 AM. 
Luckily, I'd laid out my stuff last night. No time to make coffee
but I grab a cold CuppaMochaChino (who names these things?) from the
fridge and grab a couple of granola bars to munch on the drive up
to Mukilteo.</p>

<p>While Andy drives and I eat breakfast, we chat about the riding
we've been doing. Andy recently won the first mountain bike race
he'd ever entered, his new work schedule lets him get in
century rides two days a week and he's been doing training rides with
Paul Binford. Of course, all this info is relayed in an understated,
"I'm really not in very good shape" sort of way. So Andy "really had
to scramble" in his race and can get in "just a couple of centuries"
a week and can "barely hang onto Paul's wheel". We know the rules.
Nobody ever starts out a ride saying "I feel great, I'm really
gonna hammer on this one!" Andy finishes up by mentioning how 
his hip's been bothering him and how he'll probably take it 
easy today. I recount my own problems of how work has been busy
so I could only log 2200 kilometers last month and managed to
squeeze in just a couple of 24 hour rides. </p>

<p>Brevets are not races but they are not not exactly quiet
cruises in the country, either. We are all out there testing
ourselves against the course, the clock and the conditions.
Some of us who still haven't worked past all our competive
urges also measure ourselves against other riders. Most people
will tell you that Andy and
I fall into that competitive category. My wife, who has
proven time and again that she has more common sense than
Andy and I combined, simply dismisses our actions with an
exasparated roll of her eyes and the monosylabic judgement of
"guys!"</p>

<p>This guy is too smart to compete head-to-head with Andy.
He's younger, faster and he's an annoyingly talented rider.
I content myself with working on distance rather than
speed and specializing in the odd. Last year I rode all the
brevets on a Bike Friday and this year my vehicle of choice
is a 1972 Peugeot PX-10 that I have set up as a fixed gear.
Most people assume the fixed gear bike handicaps me in some
way. If I do poorly on a ride they say "he did pretty
well considering he can't shift or coast." If I do well
they say "that's amazing considering he can't shift or
coast."</p>

<p>What these people fail to understand is that the PX-10 is
actually my not-so-secret weapon. The fixed drive-train
is more efficient than anything with deraillers and the
slack angles of the PX-10 make it the most comfortable bike
I've ever had. Every kilometer I log on the fixer makes me
stronger than I would be if I rode the same distance on a
bike that coasts, since I wind up working on the descents as 
well as on the climbs. It's different work, but it's still
work.</p>

<p>It's a bit after 5:00 AM when we pull into the church parking lot 
in Mukilteo. A few other randonneurs are already there and we all
make our way down to the ferry dock to sign in for the ride. Ken 
Carter has everything nicely organized and we sign the waivers
and get our brevet cards and cue sheet packets.</p>

<p>The ferry leaves at 6:00 AM for the brief ride over to Clinton
on the south end of Whidbey Island. There are 16 riders today. In
addition to Andy and myself, there are Tom Brett, Bill Dussler,
Don Harkleroad, Ron Himschoot, Lee Kanning, Ron Lee, Peter Liekkio,
Damian McHugh, Wayne Methner, Scott Meyers, Dick Pado, Mark VandeKamp,
Lynn Vigesaa, and Peg Winczewski. Mark and I chat a bit about
Gino Batali's passing away last week at the age of 85. "One of 
the true greats," Mark observes.  Even though we are both too
young to have ever seen him race, we've seen the photographs
and heard the stories of his epic battles in the Tour, the Giro
and Milan-San Remo.</p>

<p>
Tom, who rode a fixed gear on the 200 km, is back on his 
titanium Davidson today. He cautions me about the climb
coming out of Clinton, saying that there's a longer shallower
side road I could take instead. I tell him that I think I can
handle the hill but I appreciate his concern.</p> 

<p>The ferry docks a bit before
6:30, so we all group in a parking lot to wait for Ken to give us
the offical go-ahead. At precisely 6:30 we roll out and take off up 
the hill. It's a cool 43 degrees so I'm wearing a long sleave
jersey over my SIR jersey with a lightweight nylon windshirt over
that. I've got a camelbak holding water and food and I've got my
Burley rain jacket strapped on back just in case. I've got leg
warmers on over my shorts now but I know I'll be removing layers
of clothes as the day warms up.</p>

<p>Right now I'm warming up the best way I know how, by scooting
up the hill. This first hill leads to others and as we procede
up the island we settle into a rhythm. Andy, Mark, Tom, Bill and 
I trade off the lead for a while. I tend to pass on the climbs
and get passed on the descents. Whenever I pass Andy I say something
like "those deraillers just make you weak" and he makes a point
to be whistling a cheery tune every time he coasts by me. At one
point Mark comments that our pace seems pretty brisk but it's just
a few more minutes before he and Andy punch the pace up a bit more.
He and Andy pull out ahead. Tom and Bill are next and they pull further
ahead of me. Looking back, I see nobody.</p>

<p>It's about 60 kilometers up to Oak Harbor and for about the last
30 kilometers, I'm riding alone. In general, I prefer riding alone,
letting the road and how I'm feeling dictate my speed. It's fun to chat
with the others and ride in a pack as well but most of what I love
about riding is the simple act of rolling across the landscape, not
just taking it all in but being an active part of it. The clouds are
high in the sky, not threatening, but promising to keep the day
comfortable. Horses are grazing and trotting in fields beside the
road. Several times I see rabbits break into spontaneous sprints,
energised into action by my approach or perhaps only by their nervous 
natures. The terrain rolls on and so do I.</p>

<p>At 8:40 AM I pull into the control at the Oak Harbor AM/PM mini-mart.
Andy and Mark are long gone but Tom and Bill are still there. I get my
card stamped and buy a Frappicino and a Payday candy bar. Tom and Bill
leave before I do. I log my stats (27.8 kph average for this stage of
the ride), munch on the Payday and wash it down with the Frappicino. 
I stow my wind shirt and in ten minutes, I'm back on the road. I'm still
not seeing anybody behind me. 
</p>

<p>The next 17 kilometers are hilly but not as breezy as they were
last year when SIR ran the 300 km along this exact course. Deception 
Pass is just as beautiful as ever. I'd begun to wonder about the
how the pass got it's name and after last year's brevet I did
a little research.</p>

<p>In 1792 the Spanish and the English both sent expeditons out to
map the Puget Sound. Approaching from the west both expeditions saw
a small inlet that appeared to lead to a bay. Vancouver, the English
captain, sent his navigator, a fellow named Whidbey, to map the
bay. To Widbey's surprise, the pass actually separated two islands (now
known as Fidalgo and Whidbey Islands). Vancouver dubbed the area
Deception Pass to commemorate the way the area had deceived them.</p>

<center><img src="dpass.jpg" alt="a picture of Deception Pass"></center>

<p>I roll across the bridge (completed in 1935 by the Puget Construction
Company and the Civilian Conservation Corps) and then turn left on
Rosario Road. I occassional catch glimpses of Bill up ahead of me,
but I can't close the gap. Rosario Road merges into Campbell Lake
Road which then connects up with SR20. SR20 becomes a big road
and I follow it East for about 10 kilometers before turning
North onto the Bay View-Edison Road.</p>

<p>Today is the same day as the Skagit Spring Classic bike ride
and once I turn onto the Bay View-Edison Road, I start seeing other cyclists. 
The Spring Classic has 25, 40, 62 and 100 mile loops which overlap our
brevet course in various places. I pass by various groups of riders
as I ride through the small town of Edison.</p> 

<p>Founded in 1869 and named after the famous inventor, the 
river port of Edison used to be a bustling
timber and farm town. These days, it's a pretty quiet
place with one cafe, two taverns, one liquor store, an elementary
school, an art gallery and a population of 123 humans and 15
dogs. Edison was the boyhood home of journalist Edward R. Murrow,
but if anyone famous is living there now, they are successfully
keeping a low profile.</p>

<p> 
I turn North on Chuckanut Drive, a twisty strip of blacktop that
climbs along the western edge of Chuckanut Mountain and offers up
spectacular views of Samish Bay.
Until the completion of this road in 1896, all coastal traffic between
Bellingham and points south was done by boat. Now most North/South
traffic is on Interstate 5, but until 1931 Chuckanut Drive was
part of the Pacific Highway that stretched from Vancouver B.C. to
San Diego, CA. 
</p>

<p>After 19 kilometers on Chuckanut Drive, I turn onto Lake Samish
Road. The most notable thing about this strip of road is how it deteriorates
to a kind of rough chipseal surface. Last year, this road really slowed my 
small wheeled Bike Friday. This time, I've got full sized 25 mm Conti Sports
on the PX-10 and it doesn't seem as bad.</p>

<p>Mark Thomas has a secret control set up at the side of the road
and I pull in to get my card signed and load up on water. Mark
tells me that Bill and Tom are only a few minutes ahead and that
Andy and Mark came through about 40 minutes ago. I roll back onto
the road.</p>

<p>After another kilometer of pounding on the chipseal, the light
bracket on my Lumotec Oval Plus breaks. I guess the vibration
was too much for it. I'd heard about others having problems with
the brackets breaking, so when I'd installed my light, I'd looped
the wiring over the top of the stem. My theory was that if the
bracket broke, the wiring would hold and keep the light from crashing
to the ground or getting caught in my spokes. I'm happy to say that
this is one of those rare cases where my theory was proven out
in practice. The wire supports the light although the light
swings around like a drunken pendulum as I bounce along the
chipsealed road. I quickly grab the light to take the strain off
the wiring and gently ride the few kilometers to the Texaco
station which is serving as the next control point. I reach the Texaco
at 12:40 PM.</p>

<p>Bill and Tom are still at the control when I pull in. Bill
looks at my damaged light and asks if I have what I need to fix it.
"Yep," I reply as I dig into my saddle bag and start pulling out
stuff as I look for my stash of zip-ties. "Wow," Bill comments in
admiration as he gets a glimpse of my repair supplies, "You could
almost build an entire other bike with that stuff!" 
</p>

<p>I find the zip-ties
and secure the remaining part of the bracket to my handlebars. Tom
points out that I'll probably finish in daylight anyway, but I feel better
having all systems fully functional. In addition to the Lumotec
light, I have a backup battery-powered VistaLight headlight and
a very nifty PrincetonTec LED helmet light, so I'm even if my
Lumotec had been destroyed, I could still get home safely.</p>

<p>Tom and Bill are ready to go and take off but I've still got to 
grab some food, peel off some clothes and log
my stats. My average pace for the past 92 kilometer section was
25 kph. I grab a carton of milk, a chocolate bar and a Payday
candy bar and munch on these as I stow my long sleeve jersey
and leg warmers. The temperature is now in the mid fifties but
the sun is shining and I expect it'll be warm on the climb
up to Lake Cavenaugh.</p>

<p>I leave the control at 1:00 PM and follow the quiet country
roads South. Last year, there had been a nasty headwind on this
section but today the Skagit Classic seems to be helping
me out. I see various other riders that I figure must be riding
the Classic but they are headed North while I'm riding South. They
are riding into a headwind while I'm taking advantage of a rare
and delightful tailwind. Since Nature always tries to provide the
maximum amount of difficult for the maximum amount of cyclists, she
had no choice but to put the wind into the face of the many
Skagit cyclists and for once spare the few and hearty randonneurs!</p>

<p>I greet each and every Skagit cyclist with a large grin and friendly
wave!</p>

<p>I roll on through Mount Vernon, up and over Little Mountain Road, along
Big Lake, take a quick jog onto SR9 and then I'm onto Lake Cavenaugh
Road. This road climbs relentlessly up to the lake. Last year, the
weather was cold here and by the time we got to the lake there was
snow on the ground and slush on the road. I'd slogged up in my
granny gear then and had actually felt sorry for those with only
double chainrings on their bikes. Now, a bit over a year later,
I've got one chainring less than a double and I'm feeling pretty
good.</p>

<p>As I climb, however, I begin to despair of ever seeing Andy and Mark 
again. Grandstrom Road
splits off from Lake Cavenaugh Road about 10.5 kilometers before our
next control. The control point is up near the lake and then the
course doubles back on Lake Cavenaugh Road to Grandstrom Road. So if Andy
and Mark are more than 21 kilometers ahead of me, I won't be seeing them
coming back down. As I pass Grandstrom road, I shoot a glance up to
see if I spot them.</p> 

<p>No sign of them. The closer I get to the lake, the more
I become convinced that Andy and Mark must be HOURS ahead of me. But Gino
Batali did not give in to despair in the 1948 Tour when the younger
Bobet brought a twenty minute lead into the Alps. I pedal on.

Now I see a wonderful sight -- a couple of riders coming towards me. For
an instant I wonder if it could be Tom and Bill but no, it's Andy and Mark!
They're headed down and I'm headed up but it their lead is 
less than I'd feared. With a quick wave they are gone, but somehow
I'm climbing stronger now.</p>

<p>I pull into the control at 3:33 PM and Bill and Tom are still there. Russ
and Ken Carter are manning this control and we all chat while
I log my stats, top out my Camelbak and toss the contents of
a Coke can into my water bottle. My average pace for this 60
kilometer section was 24.7 kph. It's cooling off now, so I
put my long sleeve jersey back on.</p>

<p>"How'd you like the climb?" Tom asks, maybe innocently, or
maybe trying to get me to think about how tired I am. It's not
a race remember, but also remember we're fairly competitive guys.</p>

<p>"It's a lot better than last year," I reply, "but then I
test rode this section a couple of weeks ago. I'm just glad
I don't have to climb the passes this time."</p>

<p>This last sentence baffles both Tom and Bill, so I elaborate.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago I rode up from Issaquah, did this section and
then rode Stevens, Blewett and Snoqualmie Passes..."</p>

<p>Their eyes get wide. I'm used to getting that look from
non-randonneurs when they find out how much ground we cover
in these events, but seeing that same look on the faces of
seasoned distance riders is tremendously satisfying.</p>

<p>Tom is working on comprehending what I've just said. Very
slowly he says "You
rode up here from Issaquah and then rode the three passes..."
He seems to be making sure he heard this right.</p>

<p>Bill is sure he's heard right but he's got the obvious
logistical question, "So where'd you sleep?"</p>

<p>"I didn't," I reply, "It's only 350 miles." This last sentence
apparently does nothing to convince them that this is a
rational way to train so I quickly add "I did stop for
breakfast at the Pancake House at Snoqualmie Pass, however!"</p>

<p>As always on brevets, while we're chatting the clock is still
running. Since my descent speed on the fixed is limited by
how fast I can spin, even though I take off before Tom and
Bill, I figure they'll catch me on the descent. As I roll down
the road a few sprinkles of rain began to fall but they stop
just as quickly as they'd begun.</p>

<p>As I roll down to the Grandstrom Road turnoff, I look
for other riders coming up. I don't see anybody. Rerunning
the same calculation I'd used while looking for Mark and Andy,
I figure that the others must be at least an hour back.</p>

<p>On Grandstrom Road, Tom and Bill catch up with me and
we're pretty much together as we turn onto SR9.
A couple of dogs make raise our heartrates for
a bit and on the road to Arlington Tom and Bill build up
a pretty good lead on me.</p>

<p>At Arlington, I turn left on to Hwy 530 and then turn
up Arlington Heights Road and then onto Jordan Road. I love
this area, it's home turf for me and I've logged
many training miles here. To paraphrase a Grateful Dead
song "I know these roads we're on like I know my lady's
smile". It's nice to not be thinking about the cue sheet.</p>

<p>Jordan Road is a series of rolling climbs up to Granite
Falls. I see Tom and Bill up ahead now. They're out of
their saddles on a climb and frankly, they're looking
a little ragged. But I'm feeling good, inspired by the
road, by my classic bike, by thoughts of Batali back in
'48.</p>

<center><img src="ginobartali.jpg" alt="Gino Bartali" width="367" height="454"></center>

<p>I'm sitting down as I pass them, just like Bartali
when he took the Tour back from Bobet in '48. I roll
into Granite Falls at 5:33 PM, quite a few minutes
ahead of Bill and Tom. Andy and Mark are, of course,
still far ahead but I'm feeling good. I log my stats
(28.1 kph average for the past 51 kilometers) and
treat myself to some milk, a Frappicino and some 
chocolate. I'm munching when Bill and Tom pull in.</p>

<p>Bill speculates about the number of hills on the
rest of the course but none of us can recall much
about it from last year. We also know that road
construction has added a detour so the course
won't be quite the same anyway. I finish my snack
and head out.</p>

<p>It turns out that the detour adds a few kilometers
and one big descent at Marysville. The last
kilometers are pleasant, crossing four bridges
and sticking to good roads through Everett. I roll
along Mukilteo Boulevard and at 7:35 PM I'm at
the finishing control at the Cheers bar in Mukilteo.
Ken Carter signs my brevet card and I have a couple of
slices of pizza. Andy and Mark had finished 55 minutes
earlier. Mark's already left but Andy fills me in on
their ride. As usual, Andy had felt pretty good for the
whole ride. Mark had faded toward the end but still
managed to hang on Andy's wheel and they'd finished
together.</p>

<p>I log my final stats. For the last 44.5 kilometers
my average was 26.1 kph. My total time was 13:05 and
my computer logged the total distance as 307.74 kilometers.
My total time off the bike was about 65 minutes. This
calculates out to a rolling pace of 25.6 kph and
a rando pace of 23.5 kph. Certainly not up there
with Gino Bartali in his prime, but a reasonably fast
time for me. It's three hours faster than my time
last year.</p>

<p>Andy and I stick around long enough to see Tom
and Bill come in at 8:00 PM and then we load up my
bike and head for home.</p>

<p><b><center>400 km Preride 5/27/00</center></b></p>
<p><center>A Report by Peter McKay</center></p>
<p></p>
<p>No. . . "Easy" is not an adjective I use to describe this route!</p>


<p>Mark, Wayne and I pre-rode this year's 400 km route.  We reversed 
the traditional 3 pass route of Stevens, Blewett and Snoqualmie and 
added some new sections to familiar stretches to create a new 
twist on this perennial favorite.
</p>

<p>It's 5:00 a.m. and we leave North Bend on I-90, climbing to 
Snoqualmie Pass.  It's raining.  I-90 is not a pleasant highway.  
The shoulder is dirty, with lots of sand and tire debris.  As we 
climb and later make our way around Lake Keechelus, we are 
frequently passed by semi trucks spraying waste water as they pass.  
</p>

<p>After cresting the pass, the weather begins to improve.  I remind 
Wayne that it's good to be riding on the sunny side.
</p>

<p>We exit I-90, take an over pass and we're in Cle Elum.  The 
first control is reached by 9:30 - one hour in hand.  We 
continue, stopping occasionally to remove layers of clothing.  It's 
warming and we enjoy a very pleasant climb of Blewett Pass.   The 
descent is wonderful.  After Mark and Wayne catch me, I duck in 
behind Mark and he pulls us both to the intersection with 
Highway 2, nearly 34 kilometers.  We turn left into headwinds 
and our pace slows.  Leavenworth is reached and we now have 2 
hours in hand.  It's warm, dry, and we eat heartily.
</p>

<p>The ride from Leavenworth to Stevens Pass is beautiful!  It 
climbs gradually, following the Wenatchee River for some 
distance.  Later, it climbs and descends, letting you know 
you're going to gain it all back before reaching the pass.  At 
the Nason Creek rest stop, it begins to rain.  We put on our 
rain gear, tights and booties.  A short while later, the 
weather improves and we strip some clothing.
</p>

<p>The final climb to the pass is long and relentless.  I 
struggle with it.  At the top, the weather turns wet.  We dress 
accordingly and begin our descent.  This descent lacks all the 
enjoyment of Blewett's.  Wind is blowing rain in our faces as 
we struggle with the cold and wet.  We're tense, and frequently 
brake to maintain safe control.  Skykomish is a welcome relief.  
By this time, the thought of cliff or power bars sickens me.  
I want junk food - anything that ordinarily I don't associate 
with cycling.  A couple packages of Reeses peanut butter cups 
are my solution.  We have 2 and a half hours in hand.
</p>

<p>Before departing, the weather improves.  It's dry.  The 
stretch to Sultan is a long descent, with an occasional 
short climb.  Now, it is time for real food!  We have a 
sit-down dinner at a Mexican restaurant.  I have a 
virgin margarita.  It's not as tasty as the real thing.  
But hey, I need the salt and don't wish the dehydrating 
effect of alcohol tonight.
</p>

<p>We make the turn onto Old Owen Road.  Now begins the 
110 km hilly stretch to the finish.  Darkness came while 
we ate.  If your reach this section in the dark, I 
recommend you ride it with a buddy - at least until 
you reach Carnation.  Other than through Snohomish, most 
roads are not lit by street lamps.  It's dark, often 
very dark.  Make sure you have good working head 
lamps, and extra batteries. 
</p>

<p>Old Owen Road has a short steep climb.  You turn off it 
before reaching the top.  Reiner Road is long and winds you 
up and down before offering its last very steep climb.  
Shortly after the top, you pass a private road to the 
right (stay left) and then veer left, remaining on the 
paved road.  There is a street sign that tells you 
Reiner Road continues straight onto a dirt road.  
Don't go that way. 
</p>

<p>Continue on the paved road to the intersection, which 
tells you that you're on Old Pipeline Road.  The road 
rolls as you ride to Bollenbaugh Hill Road and onto 
Woods Creek Road.  You will miss most of the more hilly 
sections of Woods Creek Road, but it won't disappoint 
those you want more rollers.  Woods Creek becomes 
Dubuque as you pass the junction with Lake Roesiger Road.
</p>

<p>From the east, Dubuque offers some great descents and 
three climbs: one long, two short.  A left turn onto 139th 
and a few semi-residential streets leads you into Snohomish.  
</p>

<p>Wayne pulled us through the Snohomish flats, where the 
winds were gusting.  We climbed Broadway and worked our way 
to Maltby.  The Chevron closes at about 12:30.  We refueled 
with ice cream bars.  We now had 3 and half hours in hand.
</p>

<p>Paradise Lake Road to Carnation offers a steady diet 
of rollers to keep you from becoming complacent.  Somehow, we 
managed to save some energy for the last big climb of the 
night - Snoqualmie Falls.  After which, I was spent.  Mark 
and Wayne kept slowing to let me rejoin them.  But, after 
a while it was futile.  I dropped off at the last 
kilometer.  I knew I would finish soon - 4 and half 
hours in hand.
</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>

<p>Mark managed two flats.  Both Wayne and I were no 
where nearby to provide assistance. </p> 

<p>Pee breaks numbered in the very, very many.  Most 
were uneventful.  However, at one stop, I thought the 
grass shoulder would be a good place to stop.  Darn, 
that tall grass that camouflages a small cliff.  My 
eyesight at midnight, 334 km into a ride, is not too 
good.  Fortunately, a wooden fence broke my fall. 
</p>

<p>Liquid consumed - commensurate with the output.  We 
made efficient use of our stops, finding water as 
frequently as necessary.
</p>
<p>A few suggestions:</p>

<p>Much of the route between Sultan and Carnation is 
very dark at night.  Having familiarity of the route 
before hand avoids most route finding concerns.  If 
possible, ride with a buddy.  Even if you know the 
route, by this stage of the ride, one's mind is not 
as sharp.  Once or twice we questioned if we were 
on track.
</p>

<p>This ride is an exercise in body temperature control.  
Normally, I can easily manage my clothing to accommodate 
the conditions.  This ride provides a variety of conditions, 
and they frequently change.  The sun would appear from behind 
storm clouds and the temperature would rise significantly.  
The rain came and went.  I over heat on climbs and chill 
on descents.  I was constantly guessing my clothing 
combinations to best manage in this environment.
</p>

<p>Consider sleeping at the finish.  We drove straight 
home.  Crossing the West Seattle Freeway, I fell 
into dream sleep.  Awakened by the lane divider 
bumps, I managed to make it home.
</p>
<p>*	*	*</p>

<p>Finally, a big thanks to Mark and Wayne!  It is a 
pleasure to ride with you!  You carried me through some 
difficult stretches.  The ride was very enjoyable.  
I'm glad we shared it  Mark, thanks for all the effort 
you put into making this route.  I enjoyed the many 
test rides it took to bring it together.
</p>
<p>As we completed our brevet cards, Mark proudly 
exclaims, "No one will say this route is too easy!"  No, 
at 12,500 feet of climbing, it wasn't easy.  But, I'm 
happy I rode it.
</p>
<p>Next up - working the 400 km controls and, then the 
600 km.  Wayne promises if you like climbing, the 
600 km will also not disappoint.

<p><b>How I Joined The I.V. League: A Nonlinear Narrative Of The SIR 400 km
</center></b></p>

<p><center>by Mark VandeKamp</center></p>

<p><b>The End:</b></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Jan, but I'm done for the day."  I finally say what I 
have known for the last 10 miles since we left Shohomish and my 
stomach reverted to an all-too-familiar nausea.  I am only 36 miles 
from the finish of the SIR 400 km, but the cost of finishing has risen 
beyond my threshold.  I'm sitting on the sidewalk in front of the 
Chevron station on Paradise Lake Road. Jan has just come out of 
the store, walking past his purple Jack Taylor tandem, bringing 
me a cup of ice water.  He's not surprised by my announcement 
and his reaction is completely reasonable.  "OK.  What do you 
want to do?"  I explain that I will call my wife, Jane, who can 
pick me up and take me home.  Jan can ride the tandem alone to 
the finish and drive my car to his house.  I'll pick it up 
tomorrow.  Everything will work out fine.  Our experiment 
with riding a tandem fast and far will conclude with 
negative results, but what is the use of doing experiments 
if one always knows the outcome?  Obviously, some of them 
turn out in ways you don't prefer.
</p>
<p>I call Jane on the telephone and she sounds concerned 
but not overly so.  I have to hurry the end of the 
conversation because my stomach is churning.  I hang up 
the phone, kneel on the concrete and vomit.  "I guess 
that means I made the right decision," I think to 
myself.  When I had vomited back in Snohomish my 
nausea had eased and I thought that my stomach would 
be able to handle plain water, taken little sips 
at a time.  Clearly I had been wrong.
</p>
<p>Jan offers to stay with me until Jane gets here, 
but I don't know what he can do to help, and daylight 
is wasting.  I tell him I'll be fine and send him 
off to pedal the tandem up the hill alone.  I do 
feel a little better, but every sip of water is a 
struggle with my stomach.  I start thinking about 
what I'm going to do when Jane gets here.  The 
options seem to be getting narrower all the time.
</p>
<p><b>The Middle:</b></p>
<p>Riding a tandem down a long mountain-pass descent 
is almost like cheating.  The speed comes easily and 
we are tucked and flying down the moderate grades 
and easily spinning out a 54-13 gear on the sections 
where the gradient decreases to relatively mild levels.
The altitude gains that took big chunks of time spin 
away in mere minutes as we leave Swauk Pass behind 
and rush north toward Highway 2 and a left turn to 
Leavenworth. It's a beautiful day, the warmest this 
year in Washington, and I can smell the distinctive 
scent of the dry pine forests of the Eastern Cascades.  
It's a different world from the rampant green 
moistness of the West-side that we had left behind 
this morning after climbing Snoqualmie Pass and will 
enter again after crossing Stevens Pass.
</p>

<p>I'm disappointed to see the junction with Highway 
2.  The descent is over and another uphill stretch 
awaits us.  Still, the true climbing won't begin for 
awhile, and the flats go by quickly on the tandem.  
"Two down and one to go," is my optimistic thought, 
although I know that shorter, steeper hills wait 
for us on the greener side of the mountains.  We 
are about 100 miles into the ride and are averaging 
over 19mph.  It's still easy to be optimistic at this point.
</p>
<p>Jan is eager to press on and we make a short stop 
in Leavenworth.  I always marvel at the fake Bavarian 
atmosphere that has been created to lure tourism to 
this little town founded on timber and fruit orchards.  
Not much time to soak it in today, although it seems 
that we hit every red light in town.
</p>
<p>It's about 50 miles to the next control in 
Skykomish and I make a rough estimate that my bottle 
and a half of Gatorade will be enough to get there.  
I don't take into account the rising thermometer or 
the amount of climbing ahead.  My thoughts are up 
the road.  I've been meeting my goal of eating and 
drinking at a good rate, and I slurp a can of Ensure 
at the first sign that the climbing toward Stevens 
Pass has begun.  One of the beautiful things you can 
often experience on mountain highways is a clear, 
boulder-strewn river running alongside.  The 
Wenatchee River is no exception.  It roars over 
falls in white boils and runs clear and slightly 
green like old bottle-glass in the deeper, slower 
sections.  For some reason, the road looks like 
it runs downhill in some places here, but the 
effort required to pedal and the unending flow 
of the water argue adamantly otherwise.
</p>
<p>The climb up Stevens takes place in full sun 
and is taking longer than I had so flippantly 
estimated back in Leavenworth.  My bottles are 
empty and there are more than six miles to climb.  
Jan and I talk about the snow on the slope above 
the road on our left, and the rivulets of water 
running off the rocks.  He suggests that the 
water will be fine and I willingly agree.  Traffic 
is light and we angle across the four lanes of 
highway and stop on the shoulder.  Without 
thinking, I almost dip water out of the 
main stream running down the ditch alongside 
the road, but Jan shouts and points to a 
small waterfall a few feet away.  The water 
is icy and soaks my gloves as I fill a bottle.  
Then it's back on the tandem, across the road, 
and up the unending gradient.  The cold water 
tastes good, but I'm tiring and getting hot.  
I touch my temple and my fingers come away 
white with salt.  The dry air of the 
East-side absorbs sweat quickly and I've 
been losing more liquid than I've realized.  
The optimism of the Swauk Pass descent is 
fading fast.
</p>
<p><b>The Beginning:</b></p>
<p>	Riding with someone who is faster than you 
is a lot like being in High School and hanging 
out with a richer, more sophisticated crowd of 
kids.  In both cases you end up spending resources 
you don't really have, you rationalize away 
well-founded doubts, and sometimes you end up 
puking in public.  
</p>
<p>Jan had asked me if I wanted to make an 
attempt on the Cannonball tandem record back in 
the fall.  I was flattered and intrigued, but a 
bit hesitant as well.  Part of the reason I had 
started doing rando brevets was to try and find 
a better balance between my competitive instincts 
and my enjoyment of simply riding a bicycle -- now 
I was being offered a chance to set one of the 
highest goals I had ever attempted.  Jan has had 
high finishes in many of the long rides in the 
region - Cannonball, S2S, RAMROD - so he was 
clearly both serious and capable.  We have similar 
riding styles and although riding a tandem slightly 
muted our mutual strength in climbing, it added 
greatly to our speed on the descents and flats.  
After some hesitation, I said I'd do it, with 
the mutually agreed-on condition that we would 
ride the 400 km together as a test.  Now that day is here.
</p>
<p>It has not been the ideal training year for 
record attempts.  I was doing well through January 
and February, but even with my lofty goals, bicycling 
is not the highest of my life priorities, and those 
higher priorities have intruded on training time 
and intensity.  This is a new attempt at balance 
for me.  The last time I really set a high 
athletic goal was in 1991 when I completed 
Ironman Canada.  That year training was my 
priority.  In the past months I have sometimes 
wished to return to that single-minded focus, 
and sometimes wished that I had no purpose 
for getting on my bicycle except the very 
ride I was about to take.  I really was 
seeing the ride as a test.  Not only of 
how well we would do, but how it would 
feel.  Would it really be fun?
</p>
<p><b>The Epilogue:</b></p>
<p>About an hour after Jan rides off I'm in the 
emergency room at University of Washington Medical 
Center and a liter of saline with dextrose is 
draining into my arm.  Even in the emergency 
room where strange occurrences are everyday 
events the nurses give you funny looks when 
you tell them you got dehydrated riding 210 
miles on your bicycle.  Adding the small 
detail that the ride had also included 
three mountain passes doesn't help the 
situation.
</p>
<p>A liter of saline takes about 25 minutes 
to drain into my arm, and I spend enough time 
on the bed to empty three bags.  The doctor 
gives me some anti-nausea medicine that causes 
drowsiness and I sleep through most of bag 
number two.  I get up to pee halfway through 
bag number three, which feels like a pretty 
big milestone on this very long day.  Pretty 
soon thereafter, I walk out of the emergency 
room feeling like a very different person 
than when I came in.  A short drive home, 
a shower I barely remember, and the feel 
of my cheek on the cool pillow of my 
bed end the day.
</p>
<p>Although I called Jane from Paradise Lake, 
my experiment as a tandem stoker had really 
finished on the rollers between Sultan and 
Snohomish.  I wasn't prepared for the 
combination of warm weather and exertion.  
I've never been at my best in hot weather, 
and in retrospect it is also pretty clear 
that the times I have done events lasting 
longer than 9 or 10 hours I often seem to 
have problems. These signs are too foreboding 
to attempt Cannonball, a race that spends 
the majority of its 275 miles in the 
Eastern Washington Desert.  It's hard to 
give up the goal, but there is also a 
sense of relief.  I learned a lot on this ride.  
One thing in particular that I will strive 
to remember in the future is that dehydration 
is sneaky -- it doesn't take super-human 
willpower to push into a dangerous zone.  I 
used to assume that the people who ended up 
hooked up to IVs were pushing themselves a 
lot harder than I do.  I won't assume that anymore.
</p>
<p>A couple days later, I'm fine.  In fact, my legs 
feel better than they have felt in the past after 
such a long and hard event. I'll be back to ride 
the 600 km later this summer, but I'll be a different 
rider - a slower, healthier, more realistic rider, 
enjoying riding my bicycle.

<center><p><b>Randonneuring in Russia</b></p></center>

<center><p>by Jim Trout</p></center>


<p>Hello my SIR friends!  Just wanted to let you know about my wonderful
experience in Russia with the Baltic Star Randonneurs...</p>

<p>What could be more fullfiling?  Riding my bike 210 days in a row through the
world's best scenery is a dream come true.  However, I surprisingly felt
something absent...and I found out what it was while scanning the web in
London:  my beloved brevets!!  So I hopped on the RUSA page to get to the
Adaux Paris site.  I looked up the world calendar and  found two
possibilities that coincided with Odyssey2000:  Oslo 1000 km July 21 and St.
Petersburg 600 km July 27.  My girlfriend Natalie signed up for Austria
Ironman scheduled for July 23, so I opted for St. Petersburg.  The contact
info only contained an address in Russia; no phone, no e-mail.  I sent
"Andrei" a letter containing my info and e-mail from Belfast and thought
chances were very slim he'd receive it within 3 weeks.  My plan was to
tackle the Russian Visa, lodging, & transportation  issues first, then worry
about the ride later.  I got everything set with visa in Denmark, flight was
booked to fly Copenhagen-St. Pete via Pulkovo airlines, & lodging set at a
hostel in the heart of town.  Hard part OVER!</p>

<p>The Monday before our Thursday arrival in Russia, I received an e-mail from
my contact Andrei.  I was SO excited!!  We then were in daily contact via
e-mail, and he greeted Natalie and me at the airport with more enthusiasm
then I thought possible to emminate from a human.  The Batic Stars are a
young club; only a few years old.  Andrei was their strongest rider (600 km
in 22hrs!) until his FOURTH bike-car altercation lay him bed-ridden for a
while.  He still has a couple screws in his leg.  Nat & I were escorted by
bike (we set up our bikes at the airport and rode with luggage on back) to
Andrei's house.  He spoke enough English so we could carry on a
conversation.  We felt very welcome as he, wife, & friend fed us local
snacks and tea.  The following day, Nat & I ate dinner with Andrei's
fluent-English speaking friend, Anton.  He converted the route guide from
Cyrillic to Roman letters and went over some of the rules and last minute
route changes.</p>

<p>To the Ride!!!  Eleven of us rendezvoused at the statue of Lenin at the
Finland train station at 7am Saturday for a 7:30 start.  I was 1 of 2
cyclists wearing a helmet.  I had on a nice Gortex jacket, tights, and SPD
Sidi shoes, the others sweats, running shoes (no toe-clips), and no gloves. 
Although I "streamlined" my bike with 23mm tires, my Raleigh Odyssey bike
was quite a site to see compared to their cycles.  Most bikes were your
basic garage beater:  10 speed, down-tube shifters, steel frame, suntour
parts.  I'm not bashing their bikes at all, just amazed that they don't
think twice about a 640km ride on a classic bike from the 80s.  The standard
of living and opportunities for the people has some catching up to do, and
there is tremendous potentil here.</p>

<p>So back to biking.  We received our brevet cards, and since the route was so
desolate and they only had one support car (very scary little car...I wasn't
sure if the CAR could make it the entire journey!), we needed 10 postcards
addressed to Andrei to drop off in each checkpoint town for proof of passing
through.  I was informed that 40km of the route was gravel road, we
shouldn't ride alone throught the
Karelian province during night because of wild animals and perhaps wild
people, and the route was 640km with option of 800km.  640km marks a train
station to transport back to St. Petersburg.  800km marks the entire Lake
Ladoga loop back to St. P.</p>


<p>We all stuck together the first 115km, but man what a pace!  First 100 km in
less than 3hrs.  I knew I couldn't hold that pace for 540 more km, so
fortunately I had a flat!  Yes, I was happy to have a flat.  Afterfixing the
flat, I kept a pace of 25-29km/hr, but didn't catch up to the next rider
until 290km mark.  Andrei, following us in a car with a video recorder most
of day, had set up 3 tents for the riders.  It was 7:30pm, and we were about
to enter the Karelian province.  Two other riders were there (Michael &
Vladamir), and we all agreed on sleeping until 12am and then to ride
together in the night. We awoke to light rain and were off by 12:30am after
helping Andrei break down camp.  He is such a funny guy with tons of
enthusiasm!!  I used my headlamp to help take out stakes and pick up other
items, then tended to my own bike to get ready for departure.  He wanted to
make a final sweep of the lot, and since I was busy, he borrowed Vladamir's
bike and, while lifting it at an angle, walked around singing "Oh, where are
you, my beautiful parts?"  Funny if you were there.</p>

<p>The night riding was eventful in that we needed to stop every 10-15km. 
Among the three of us and the bumpy road, stuff was flying off our bikes
every 20-40minutes.  At times we'd lose 3-4 parts of a front light and set a
time limit of 5 min to find them.  So picture 3 guys out in the wee hours of
the night roaming around the middle of the road searching for light parts. 
I loved it!  Although I felt rested fom the 4 hour nap, I greeted the 5am
sunlight with half-open eyes.  The two suggested a 10min nap on the side of
the road, but it proved futile as mosquitos were rampant.  Vlad gave me some
of his powder drink with caffeine, and we forged onward.  An hour later I
felt AWESOME and bid adieu to Mike and Vladamir.  The terrain finally came
to life:  only 2000ft climbing 1st 400 km, then 8000ft last 240km (I love
hills).  I didn't see any other riders the rest of the trip as I averaged
30km/hr over the next 3 hours!</p>

<p>The sun came out FULLY for the first time around 1pm Sunday. I calculated my
arrival time to be ~4pm.  Foolish me, for then the ugly 40km of gravel
appeared.  Talk about a terrible nightmare come true!  Imagine the sandiest,
chunkiest, pot-holiest, hardest ripple-bumps gravel road.  Now add a bit of
traffic to throw dust in your face and 23mm tires that get trapped in the
sand grinding the bike to a halt every 100m.  Lastly, picture doing this for
3hrs.  Yuck. Tough way to end the ride!  I arrived at 6:30pm Sunday, or 35
hours afer the start.  I was 7th, 4rs behind the 1st riders.  Four riders
were already forging on to St. Petersburg via bicycle!  I am very impressed
with the Baltic Star Randonneurs!  I caught the 8pm train and arrived in St.
P 11:30pm. Fortunately our hostel was 3 blocks away from the station.  I got
some chicken kiev at the local cafe, showered and fell asleep by 1am.</p>

<p>I awoke monday with fresh eyes and very little ill-effects from the weekend.
My cold was worse than Thursday, but I was still surprised at my "recovery."
Nat & I spent the day doing some errands and exploring.  At 7pm we headed
for Andrei's flat to visit with all the riders at a planned tea party.  We
shared stories of the trip, toasted with cognac and vodka ~every 30min, and
watched the video Andrei filmed.  I felt like a celebrity, and it was hard
to leave!  I gave Andrei my SIR jersey (can I still buy one for me?), and he
gave me his club rain jacket, a small banner of Lenin, and a couple video
tapes (PBP '99, Baltic Star '99 & '00 600 km brevets).  I have tons of
pictures and would love to show them to all when I return in January.</p>


<p>
Andrei is looking for sponsorship for BMB or RM 1200 or any other trip to
the States.  I think at the least we could develop some sort of connection
with the Baltic Star club so that it would facilitate any of us visiting the
respective country.  They are planning on extending the 800km to 1000 next
year.  The scenery is fair and roads were pretty rough (next time fatter
tires!), but the fact that I was riding on the backroads of RUSSIA gave me
incredible insight to the people and way of life of what I knew so little
about.</p>

<p>So that's the scoop with Baltic Star.  I have many new friends in Russia,
and I'm sure they would LOVE to meet anyone from the US.  Definately one of
my cycling highlights of all time!

<P><center><b>The Owls Are Not What They Seem</b></center></P>

<P><center>by Mark E. Vande Kamp</center></P>


<br>

<P>What?  A road ride at night through Mount Rainier National 
Park.  Total distance of about 78 miles with 
more than 6,000 feet of climbing.</P>

<P>Who?  Mark Vande Kamp, riding a custom steel rando/all 
rounder with a Schmidt hub/Lumotec and a Cateye HL500II 
backup.  Andy Fuller, riding a steel LeMond with three 
Cateye HL500IIs -- the primary with an external battery pack.</P>

<P>Where?  Start at Sunshine Point Campground, just inside 
the Nisqually entrance to the park (SW corner).  Ride up to 
Paradise, descend through Stevens Canyon, head South to 
Packwood, return to Nisqually entrance via Skate Creek Road.</P>

<P>When?  Friday, Sep. 15 at about 9:00 PM to Saturday, Sep. 16 
at about 2:30 AM.</P>

<P>Why?</P>

<P>Setting out in the darknes, the road I have traveled many times 
by car and bicycle looks different.  Our headlights shine in 
narrow beams that light the road but leave the old-growth forest 
alongside in darkness.  The pavement curves to skirt Douglas Firs 
and Western Hemlocks that aren't quite large enough to drive a 
car through, but a bike path would fit easily.  Some trees are 
so close to the road that I could reach out with my right arm 
and brush my fingertips along the rough bark, but I don't.</P>

<P>We warm quickly on the gentle grade and stop to take off 
our jackets before the grade gets steeper at Longmire.  Under 
a streetlight at the oldest tourist site on the mountain I 
tell Andy about the mineral springs in the meadow across 
the road, and point out the trees that are retaking the 
area now that the age-old Native American practice of 
periodically setting fire to the grass has stopped.  We 
set off and in a single curve of the road we have 
left civilization and reentered the forest.  The 
two-lane blacktop seems a thin sliver of technology, 
overwhelmed by the organic richness of the living 
landscape that flanks the pavement and towers overhead.</P>

<P>The road has straightened and we can look ahead and 
upward to see the sky.  I picked this night to ride because 
of the moon that was full only two nights ago.  There are 
clouds around the mountain, but the moon is now visible 
through a filmy break.  The whiteness of the slightly 
dented circle brings to mind Galen Rowell's photographic 
advice that, "the moon is a sunlit object".  At times 
the moonlight is bright enough on the road ahead that 
I think a car must be approaching, but almost always 
the light has come shining downward from a break in the clouds.</P>

<P>We are climbing steadily up the side of the Nisqually 
valley and the ground drops off sharply on the right side of 
the road.  I can see up and across the valley to the ridgeline 
that is swathed in cloud.  We are headed up there and I'm nervous 
about the cold, wetness, and poor visibility that might lie ahead.  
Andy and I can always turn back, but I hope that won't be 
necessary.  I decide not to think about what we should do if 
the clouds get thicker as we descend on the other side of Paradise.</P>

<P>Clouds have a smell.  The fog turns out to be relatively thin, and 
our lights are still effective (although angular patterns of 
stray beams radiate from the edge of my Lumotec when the fog 
is at its thickest).  The road is dry and the coolness is only 
slightly clammy on my face.  However, riding into the fog is 
still a new world of sensation due to the semi-metallic tang 
of the clouds in my nostrils.  I think of ozone, and ions, and 
the contrast with the complex richness of the organic smells of 
the lower altitude forest.  I climb into the cloud -- the 
cloud flows into me.</P>

<P>We decide to stop at Paradise before descending.  Andy has 
never been to the Paradise Inn and he's impressed by the rustic 
log lobby with two huge hearths and a piano player noodling 
out tasteful tunes.  I feel like a creature from the 
netherworld, with my black lycra tights and reflective 
helmet as I walk through chatting groups of lodge guests 
to visit the restroom.  Eyeballs follow us out the door 
and we mount up laughing about what the conversations 
inside must sound like.  Much like at Longmire, the 
lights and warmth are gone after the first curve and 
we are once again alone on the road.</P>

<P>Descending Stevens Canyon in the dark is not as 
much fun as in daylight.  My earlier nerves prove unfounded 
and we are quickly below the clouds.  Still, I know that 
rocks have a tendency to fall onto this stretch of road 
and I'm straining to see if any will appear at the front 
limit of my headlight.  I try not to ride the brakes too 
much and I periodically check my mirror to see Andy's 
headlights behind me.  Halfway down the valley I stop 
for a moment to wait for Andy and look out over the 
scene in the moonlight.  The upper portion of the valley 
is lost in the clouds, as is Mount Rainier, which would 
loom like a monstrous white mushroom on a clearer night.  
Still, the moon is bright through the broken mist that 
blows across it.  I can see the sweep of the valley wall 
opposite me and pick out the bare areas where black 
basalt defies the greenery.  Far below I can clearly 
hear Stevens Creek.  I know where it runs at the 
bottom of the v-shaped canyon, but tonight the water 
is heard but not seen.  Andy stops and we stand and 
look for a few moments before rolling ahead.</P>

<P>We are climbing Backbone Ridge after losing 
enough elevation to reenter the forest.  From 
our left we hear the classic hoot -- a Great-Horned 
Owl, I would guess.  Andy and I glance at each other, then 
we hear a different owl call from ahead on the left, and 
a third from ahead on the right.  We ride slowly on, but 
we have apparently left the disputed territory.  I don't 
know enough about owls to know whether all three calls 
came from a single species, or whether the second and 
third call might have come from the rare and 
controversial spotted owl.  It really doesn't 
matter much at the moment.  The owls called, and 
we ride through the darkness listening.</P>

<P>The descent from Backbone Ridge to the Grove 
of the Patriarchs is my favorite stretch of road 
in the park.  The pavement is smooth, the grade is 
moderate, and there are big sweeping switchbacks 
that can be taken at speed.  I find myself grinning 
as I take a curve.  I'm riding the inside edge of 
my headlight beam, weight balanced on my outside 
pedal, carving a smooth arc through the still air 
of the night.  Normally a cautious descender, I ride 
slightly outside my comfort zone, unwilling to brake, 
rushing forward to stretch the moment.</P>

<P>Again we are climbing, spinning alongside the 
white noise of Skate Creek.  The second-growth forest 
here is dominated by Alders whose limbs span the road, 
creating a dark tunnel that blocks the moonlight.  The 
world has contracted as the noise and the darkness block 
out the environment.  Although we have talked about many 
things during the earlier climbs, Andy and I are silent 
as we spin upward, periodically up-shifting to stand, 
matching our rhythms.  There are campsites along the 
road, but it's after midnight and most are silent.  A 
campfire is briefly visible on our right, but we glide 
past like ghosts and I wonder if our presence has 
been noticed at all.</P>

<P>Bear Prairie Summit is a weak climax to this final
 climb of the night.  I notice the open area on our left 
 and tell Andy that I think we will start descending 
 again. In an unspoken agreement we maintain a moderately 
 high effort level, pushing big gears down the gentle 
 grades, riding alongside each other and pooling headlights.  
 My legs feel strong and the pace is refreshing, but the 
 effort is spurred partly by the thought of my sleeping 
 bag. Back home in Iowa they would say that we are 
 smelling the barn.</P>

<P>At the Copper Creek Cafe I stop to call my wife from 
the pay phone so she doesn't wake up and wonder if 
things have gone awry.  She is sleepy but asks about 
the ride.  "It's been great," I say, but it's both too 
soon and too late to offer much more.  Andy and I set 
off to spin the last few miles back to the car.  We 
see a deer walking alongside the road but it is 
behind us almost before we can comment.</P>

<P>I lay down and my body feels warm in the sleeping bag 
as I look for a star or two while settling in.  I close 
my eyes and see the faint after-image of my headlight 
beam.  My inner ear leans left and right through the 
curves of the road into sleep.  My body has not let 
go of the impressions of the night, but I know 
that they will fade quickly.</P>

<p>One hundred kilometers is too short a distance to be

<p><center><b>Millersylvania Ride (3/25)</b></center></p>

<p><center>by Duane Wright</center></p>

<p>You may recall, several months ago, Bill Scheidt and Melody
Mayer, from Olympia, proposed a ride for us randonneurs, down in
their neck of the woods. You may also recall seeing them on our
200 km and 300 km last year. They ride a tandem and Melody is noted
for riding with several bags of rice cakes somehow attached to
her.</p>

<p>Four tandems and a single (fixed gear, Kent!) came down to
Olympia from Seattle. Bill and Melody did not disappoint us. It
was a great ride, complete with great weather (oh, and a few
great hills throw in, for exercise). The 85 mile loop was almost
entirely on quiet roads. Starting from Millersylvania State Park
(just south of Olympia), we headed west, then eventually south
through the Lincoln Creek Valley (on the Two County Double Metric
Century route), before a lunch stop in Centralia.</p>

<p>After lunch the route went east, eventually looping around the
Centralia Steam Plant and the large, terraced basin that it sits
in. The plant is huge and comes as a surprise when one is
meandering through a peaceful, nearly unpopulated rural area.
From there we headed back west, through Tono and then Tenino (on
the STP route). Finally our tired group was back at the park.</p>

<p>The general consensus was that Bill and Melody were the
strongest tandem team. Fortunately they slowed down to ride with
us. The only person actually able to keep up with them was Moe
Moosavi, on his fixed gear. Fixed gears are faster, of course,
because they don't have all of that heavy stuff, like cogs, chain
rings, derailleurs, and levers to slow them down.</p>

<p>Just before lunch (i.e. when the energy reserves were low) the
timing chain came off (loose eccentric) on Linda Knapp's tandem.
She said it really wasn't a problem but SHE wasn't stoking! We
slogged along, for several miles, on one engine (me!) before
catching up with the waiting group. Between us we came up with
enough tools to tighten the eccentric and get rolling again.</p>

<p>In September I'm the organizer for the S.I.R. fall 100 km. It
will probably be a shortened version of this course. Mark your
calendars, cancel your vacation plans -- you won't miss the
traffic.</p>

<p><center><b>SIR 200 km</b></center></p>

<p><center>4/1/2000</center></p>

<p><center>by Kent Peterson</center></p>

<p>S. J. Perelman observed, "The comic writer is constantly
searching for difficulties. One subjects himself to stress and
difficulty that one can make copy out of. If your obligation is
to amuse your readers then you try to get into dilemmas that are
grievous to yourself but not necessarily wounding or completely
shattering." Perelman would've found the April 1st
SIR 200 km quite a literary challenge.</p>

<p>The problem was the weather. There wasn't enough of it.
Any true randonneur will tell you (at length and in great detail
unless you run quickly away) that randonneuring is all about
riding vast distances in miserable conditions. Ideally, it should
be dark and cold and if not actually snowing there should at
least be relentless soul-numbing rain. Even the smallest
hailstorm can add an immeasurable epic element to a ride and
winds strong enough to fling tree limbs onto the roadway are most
prized by the randonneuring raconteur.</p>

<p>Alas, April 1st played us all for fools and dawned clear and
comfortable. I know how it dawned because dawn found me on my
bicycle, riding the 42 kilometers down to Greg Cox's house.
I was hoping for some element of intrigue to punctuate my
pre-light pre-ride but there were no suicidal squirrels to dart
into my path, no carloads of carousing characters to hurl drunken
insults at me and not even a carnivorous cocker spaniel lying in
wait by a garden gate. No, the ride to Greg's was
disturbingly uneventful.</p>

<p>By the time I arrive at the park by Greg's house at 6:15
AM the sun is up and many of my randonneuring companions are
signing in and making final clothing decisions. While the
mainstream press may fail to recognize the cyclist as a
bellwether of fashion, the true randonneur has a deep and
hard-earned knowledge of the sartorial arts. This comes from our
innate desire at all times to be in a state similar to Baby
Bear's porridge -- neither to hot nor too cold but
occupying that ideal state known as "just right".
Since I had chosen to ride to Greg's, my decisions had been
made hours ago and had to allow for the bit of cool dark riding.
I was wearing: one pair of SmartWool socks, one pair of
Look mountain bike shoes, one pair of Pearl Izumi leg warmers,
one pair of Sugoi shorts, one red Pearl Izumi long sleeve top,
one short sleeve RUSA jersey, one LL Bean nylon Zephyr wind
shirt, one thin REI balaclava, my cotton Campagnolo cap, a Giro
Stevilo helmet and one pair REI windblocker fleece gloves.
I'm slightly under-dressed for standing around.</p>

<p>The group that takes off at 7:00 AM is mix of many of the
usual suspects plus a few new recruits. Terry Z and Anne Marie
are piloting one of their rocket-powered tandems. Jim Giles is at
the helm of his Gold Rush recumbent. Ken Carter's on his
carbon Trek with the swayback Brooks Pro saddle. Mark
VandeKamp's riding his "yeah it's steel but
TiCycles put it together" do everything bike. Ken Stagg is
looking like he'd been doing this for years on his Heron.
Ron Lee and Lynne Vigesaa were looking happy and ready to ride.
Eric Courtney, who I'd last seen providing moral support at
the 100 km was here to ride today. Mark Thomas had decided once
again to tempt fate by using fancy-schmancy carbon spoked wheels
on his Litespeed. Wayne Methner is also Litepeed-equipped but
Peter McKay is representing the "heck you don't need
fancy stuff" school of thought by riding his mountain bike.
Tom Brett and I take that philosophy to the next illogical step
by both riding fixed gear bikes. Tom's is an 80's
vintage Trek and mine is the classic "if it was good enough
for Merckx, it's good enough for me" 1972 Peugeot
PX-10. Ewen Tait, Peg Winczewski, Scott Myers and Damian McHugh
are riders who I haven't seen before at SIR rides.</p>

<p>A quick descent followed by a couple of quick turns and
we're on the Soos Creek Trail. Mark VandeKamp and Ken
Carter are in the lead with the rest of us close behind. Our next
turn is to be a left onto 148th SE and when Ken turns left on an
unmarked road we all follow with a herd instinct that would make
your average lemming look like an anarchist. Of course, this road
is not 148th SE. We all realize this at about the same time,
swoop back to the trail and resume our journey. At the end of the
trail, we find a locked gate and the real 148th SE. We go over,
under or around the gate and onto the road.</p>

<p>We cross the Kent-Kangley Road and roll on toward Black
Diamond. Ken is setting the pace but Tom Brett and I are close
behind. "Make sure he doesn't stop pedaling!"
Tom says as Ken punches things up a notch and I up my RPMs to
keep pace. I catch and pass Ken on one of the gentle descents on
the Kent Black Diamond Road. I think Ken was a bit startled when
I when passed him. Fixed gear bikes are not known for their speed
on descents, but Ken hadn't made allowance for the Caffeine
Calorie Closure Coefficient (CCCC or C4). In layman's
terms, C4 states that the velocity of any bicycle I'm
riding increases as the distance to a bakery (especially one that
serves coffee) decreases. Thanks to the C4 effect, I'm the
first rider into the control at the Black Diamond Bakery. The
sweet young thing at the counter stamps my control card and makes
me short caramel latte. On previous brevets I'd learned
that the magic words "not too hot" ensure a drink
that can be quickly slammed down. I also paused to peal off my
wind shirt and balaclava, swap my fleece gloves for mesh cycling
gloves and wolf down a granola bar. I was quick but Ken and Mark
VandeKamp were quicker. Now we're back onto the road and
heading towards Hobart.</p>

<p>We cross the Kent-Kangly road at Ravensdale and while I catch
glimpses of Mark, I don't see Ken until I spot him
returning from the control at the Hobart Market. This leg of the
brevet is a little out and back stretch, so it's a good
chance to figure out where people are relative to each other. I
catch up with Mark at the market (35 kilometers into the ride)
and don't waste much time getting my card signed. Mark
leaves the market a bit ahead of me and I'm gone before the
next riders pull in.</p>

<p>On the ride back to Ravensdale, we see the rest of the riders.
At Ravensdale we head East on the Kent Kangly Road and then South
on the Retreat Kanaskat Road. After five kilometers or so the
route turns right on the Cumberland Kanaskat Road. Along this
road Greg Cox has set up a secret control. I pull in just as Mark
is pulling out.</p>

<p>I catch up with Mark again at the Enumclaw control at
kilometer 65. I eat half a muffin poppy seed muffin here and
refill my water bottle. Bill Dussler tells me that Ken Carter
passed through about five minutes earlier. By the time I'm
rolling again, Mark's out of sight.</p>

<p>I ride south to Buckley and now I'm riding in terrain
that's new to me. I get a touch off course before I find
River Avenue but then the navigation is simple along routes 165
and 162. I follow the sign pointing to Electron and turn onto the
Orville Road.</p>

<p>It's getting quite warm now. After another 10 kilometers
where the road turns left, I stop at a mini-mart. I haven't
seen Mark or Ken in quite some time and I haven't seen any
of the folks who are behind me either. I peal off my leg warmers,
put on some sunscreen and rig my bandana as a
Lawrence-of-Arabia-style neck cover. I buy a pint of milk, a
bottle of water and a bottle of a peach/berry juice blend. I eat
a handful of cashews, a Slim-Jim, and a granola bar from my food
stash and wash it down with the milk. I refill my water bottle,
stuff the juice bottle in my jersey pocket and hit the road
again.</p>

<p>Orville Road goes by a couple of small lakes and then connects
up with SR 161 for a two-kilometer climb up to Eatonville. This
section reminds me of P-B-P because the French love to put their
controls at the top of hills.</p>

<p>Eatonville (kilometer 121) is an open control, so I follow the
loop for the business district and find a grocery store. Ken
Carter is here and he asks me where Mark is. I figure he has to
be in front of me, but we can't figure out where he went. I
go into the store, buy a Mocha Frappucino and get my card
stamped.</p>

<p>I compliment Ken on the great ride he's having but he
says, "I've got gears and can coast. I know
that's cheating in your book!"</p>

<p>"No," I reply, "I just think that stuff
slows you down."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd better get going then," he says
and heads off down the road. He moves pretty fast for a guy whose
bike is made out of a mixture of pencil lead and glue.</p>

<p>I drink down my Frappucino and head back. Again the course is
doubling back on itself, so I get to see all the others. Terry Z
and Anne Marie, Mark Thomas, Wayne, Peter and Tom are all pulling
into town as I'm heading out and then on Orville Road I see
the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>Up ahead I see a rider and it doesn't look like Ken. It
must be Mark. On some sections I can see a rider still farther
ahead and I figure that must be Ken. For a while I think I can
catch them but eventually Mark catches up with Ken and they ride
off.</p>

<p>At South Prairie I stop again for a quick granola bar and
juice snack. Then it's up to Buckley and Highway 410 and
then country roads and the one decent climb of the ride -- the
climb out of the Green River Valley back up to the Auburn Black
Diamond Road.</p>

<p>As I'm working my way up this hill, Bill Dussler pulls
along side me in his van and asks how I'm enjoying the
climb. I can't recall my exact response, but I think it was
actually pretty civil under the circumstances. I did notice that
the climb seemed easier in the sections of the road where the
trees provided some shade. Bill assures me that it's only
about ten more miles to Greg's house.</p>

<p>The section on the Black Diamond road goes by quickly and then
it's back onto the Soos Creek trail. The trail looks quite
different from this direction and with the nice weather
it's loaded up with pedestrians, roller-bladers and dog
walkers. I always feel like a dork riding on the trail with full
road gear and this is probably my least favorite section of the
ride. I wind up turning off the trail one intersection too soon
by mistake and zip up what I think is the hill leading to
Greg's place.</p>

<p>No Greg's place. Hmm.</p>

<p>It slowly dawns on me that I've taken a wrong turn. I go
back down the hill, correct my error and at 4:02 PM I pull into
Greg's driveway. Pete Bajema, who had been thinking of
riding the 200 but ran into problems on the way to Greg's,
signs my card.</p>

<p>Ken and Mark had finished at 3:35 PM. Greg's wife had
three pots of chili going along with various other munchies and
liquid refreshments. At 4:25 PM Anne Marie and TerryZ rolled in
and at 4:55 PM Tom Brett, Mark Thomas, Peter McKay and Wayne
Methner pulled up.</p>

<p>I had to ride home and wanted to take advantage of what
daylight remained so I left around 5:00 PM but over the next few
hours everybody else rolled in. Here are the final results
including Greg and Bill's times from the pre-ride the week
before:</p>

<center><p><b>The SIR 200 km</b></p>
<p>April 1, 2000</p>
<p>by Kenneth Stagg</p>
</center>
<p>Finally, my first brevet.</p>

<p>I got a ride up to Greg's house with Peg after we figured out
that we live about 3 blocks from one another. It was nice to have
someone to talk to as I was feeling a bit nervous. I know that
for most of the people on these rides 200 km is a well known
distance but it was only going to be the third time I'd ever
ridden that far.</p>

<p>I recognized most of the people at the start from the 100 km and
the couple of SIR training rides that I'd done earlier in the
year but there were a few that I hadn't met before. One of these
turned out to be Greg Cox, the ride organizer.</p>

<p>After signing in we mill around for awhile until Greg gives us
some final instructions ("... follow the Soos Creek trail to its
end at 148th") and we're off - though I suppose that that goes
without saying.</p>

<p>Down the hill, hard left, quick right and follow the trail.
Easy right? Someone up ahead turned on an unmarked street and we
almost all obediently follow along. Baaaaaa. I turned out to be
one of the first back on the trail mostly because I'd been at the
back of the bunch when we realized that we were off course. At
the end of the trail is a locked gate with no room to go around
it so we lift our bike over - if we're smart enough - or haul
them under - breaking off a taillight in the process - if we
weren't. Oh well, thankfully I didn't need lights on this ride
(though it was a near thing.)</p>

<p>It's a quick and easy ride to the first control at the Black
Diamond Bakery. Get our cards stamped, notice that they have the
wrong time and get it done again, a quick bite and I'm back on
the bike, riding with Peg and Ewn, an AUK visiting the Pacific
Northwet. I've done this section of the ride a couple of times
before and for some reason I never do well on the first little
hillock. Again. Ah well, on to the Hobart MiniMart and the second
control, passing by most of the other riders headed the other
direction. After turning around there I see three people still
heading out to the control - at least I'm not bringing up the
tail, yet.</p>

<p>After the turn onto Kent-Kangley I'm in new territory. I
didn't even know Kanaskat existed until I read the rout sheet.
This was my favorite section of the ride, flat to rolling, sunny
but not really warm yet, rolling along chatting with Ewn and Peg.
If there'd been fewer loose dogs it would have been perfect
riding. A quick stop at the secret control and we keep on rolling
into Enumclaw and the next announced control where Bill Dussler
had water and muffins.</p>

<p>From there it's on to and, to my detriment, through Buckley. I
was originally planning on stopping here (about the 1/3 mark) and
getting something to eat but I didn't think too much of it as I
was feeling good and was enjoying riding in a group. Whoops!</p>

<p>Down the hill into the valley and along South Prairie creek we
pick up a slight head wind and then, suddenly, my legs are lead.
I try to bull my way through it and do OK until part way up the
first section of Orville Road I have to stop. I've ridden this
section before on the Daffodil Century and I know that I'm going
to need a short break. A granola bar, Gatorade and water later
I'm doing better but notice that I can't climb any more - it
doesn't hurt, there's just no power available. This will last the
rest of the day. Peg and Ewn drop me on even the smallest hill,
though I make some of it up on the downhill side, but they're
doing almost all of the pulling now. By the time I finally get up
to Eatonville I'm wondering why I'm doing this.</p>

<p>Lunch helps, as does the encouragement from Bill, who'd driven
out to the end of the course to see how everyone was doing.</p>

<p>I finally lose contact with my companions (and get passed by
one of the three people that were behind me) on the first stretch
back toward Orting and I lose more time to them when I stop at
the Kapowsin market to get more Gatorade. Still, most of this
section is downhill so it goes well enough, until I get out from
behind the hill. It's not much of a headwind but I don't have
much left. At the foot of the hill up to Buckley I see Peg and
Ewn but they take off before I get within hailing distance - just
as well really considering how much faster they're climbing.</p>

<p>At this point I checked out my mileage and time and realized
that I was certainly going to finish within the 13h30' time
limit. Whether I'd finish before dark was more problematic.
Nobody at the start had believed me when I said that I might need
the lights....</p>

<p>Up the hill, back through Buckley, on through Enumclaw, into
the breeze.</p>

<p>From Enumclaw, though, it was a fun descent into the valley of
the Green River and across it. Bill wasn't kidding about the hill
going out of the valley but by this point I'm already resigned to
twiddling up even modest rises so a mile long hill is just a
longer twiddle. On the way up I practice my bike handling at &lt;
3mph. Not too bad.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill there's a miracle. My legs are back!
Huh? Kent mentioned afterward that this section of the ride is
quite fast - I'll say! Whatever the reason it feels good to find
my big chainring again - in fact I feel pretty good all over.
Just as well, too, since the shadows are lengthening. One final
obstacle - the hill back up to Greg's house. I drop it into my
lowest gear and twiddle halfway up before deciding that I could
use a stretch. I walk the rest of the way to the top and coast to
Greg's house. 11:05 - it's less than 13:30 and that's all that I
was worried about.</p>

<p>Sitting around with everyone after the ride I'm impressed by
the amount of support that I get from the other riders. They all
encourage me to try the 300 km and offer advice on how to have a
better ride. Some mention that going through the odd bad spot is
just a part of doing these rides. I believe them, but 40 miles of
it? Still, I enjoy riding enough that it was mostly fun even when
I was feeling weak and I'm planning on doing the 300 km.</p>

<center>
<p><b>367 km to Semi-ah-moo by Team Sunnyside</b></p>
</center>

<p><center>by Peter McKay</center></p>

<p>Two teams competed in this year's Fl&egrave;che
Northwest: Team Extreme and Team Sunnyside. Pete Bajema's
Team Extreme set a goal of the longest possible route achievable
within 24 hours. Team Sunnyside set a goal for the minimum
distance (and maximum sleep and rest). Days before the start,
Kent Peterson swapped teams to fill a vacancy on Team Extreme.
Thus, both teams began with the minimum -- three members --
Extreme with Pete, Ken Carter and Kent and Sunnyside with Mark
Thomas, Wayne Methner and me.</p>

<p>Wayne and I gathered at Mark's home for a sit down
candle light dinner. Mark's son Phillip served us pasta,
salad and pork chops. Delicious! I fiddled with my front fender.
I just could not get it to stop rubbing. I didn't have this
problem on PBP. Turns out, it doesn't rub on dry pavement.
On wet ground, the front tire picks up small pebbles and sand. My
fork has too fine a clearance.</p>

<p>It's 6:00 pm, and we're off! Soon, we are on a
short stretch of the 100 km Populaire as we head to Monroe.
Across Highway 2, we're onto Woods Creek Rd, detour onto
Yeager, before returning to Woods Creek and then to Lake Roesiger
Rd. We reach the first control (Lake Roesiger Store) at 8:20. The
store closed at 7, so we sign each other's cards and turn
on our head lights.</p>

<p>As we approach Granite Falls, each car waits patiently behind
us until clear to pass. Mark suggests they are French. At the
Texaco in GF, we meet one of the drivers. She asked if it was us
she passed. We smile in agreement and thank her. Who else would
be riding at night in the rain?</p>

<p>Next stop: Arlington. We have a mild case of hill avoidance,
thus the detour onto Burn Rd seems appropriate. A lady passes,
yelling we have "Good Lights", then stops to again compliment us
on how visible we are, and to ask if we need any assistance
getting home. We reply no and that we are fine. The locals must
think we are nuts!</p>

<p>We get our cards stamped and purchase food and drink at the BP
in Arlington near I-5. The clerk warns us to avoid "Fred" and
tells us Darrington is a dangerous town. We're rolling on
530, pass the Thrifty Food Pavilion, and struggle to keep our
bicycles from turning toward Jordan Rd. It seems unnatural to
avoid that right turn. It's dark, wet and our visibility is
poor. So, why do we prefer to ride in daylight and sunshine?
We're perfectly happy tonight!</p>

<p>We reach our Darrington motel and check in at 12:40.
We're all pleased! We made good time. We shower and
wring-out wet clothes. Mark learns that his seal skin socks are
indeed waterproof. Once the water gets in, it cannot escape. He
removes his socks and pours out water! Our reward for the evening
ride is 3 hours of sleep.</p>

<p>We wake at 4:30, ready ourselves with fresh dry jerseys,
shorts and socks. The wet tights offer mild discomfort.
Weatherman Wayne looks outside and reports, "Its not raining!!!"
and closes the door. Yes, it wasn't raining under the
awning. But, it was pouring onto the parking lot and highway!</p>

<p>We pass Rockport and enter Marblemount. Mark calculates that
we need to ride to mile post 108 to compensate for our Burn Rd
detour. The time to ride the extra distance allows us to return
to a restaurant that will soon open at 7. This distance works out
well. We all eat heartily and get our cards stamped.</p>

<p>Leave the restaurant, I get the cold shakes. I had been down
this road before on last year's 400 km. This year, I am
prepared. I put on a long sleeve fleece jersey. Now, I'm
wearing 4 top layers. This does the trick as my core warms
quickly and brings heat back into my legs, toes and hands.</p>

<p>It's a long stretch to Sedro Wooley. In route, we stop
at a Chevron for refreshments. Then, we stop at the AM/PM market
at the turn to Highway 9. Before we leave, Russ Carter arrives.
He is providing support for Team Extreme, which will arrive in
another 2 &frac12; hours. We turn north toward Van Zandt, where
we stop for great deli sandwiches. In route, we hit bad railroad
tracks. Everyone stays up right, but Mark drops a water bottle,
which Wayne retrieves as Mark rolls on.</p>

<p>Soon, we approach my favorite -- the ride off Highway 9 into
Sumas. These back roads are very pleasant. Mark flatted earlier,
and replaced the tube. Now, he flats again. With road grit mud
covering all exposed surfaces, its darn near impossible to do a
thorough inspection. Mark opts for the full tire and tube
replacement. While these are changed, the weather improves. It is
remarkably warm and dry.</p>

<p>We reach the Sumas control and tempt the weather gods. We
remove a few layers of clothing, change to light gloves and dark
lenses. Never tempt the weather gods! Well, this time they
aren't too harsh -- only light sprinkles. We see blue skies
in our westward direction. The flags in Sumas gave a false sense
of wind direction. We are now into the typical headwinds of the
northern Whatcom County flats.</p>

<p>We reach Lynden for our 22 hour stop. Dutch apple pies with
ice cream and coffee are our reward.</p>

<p>Mark did an excellent job designing the route. His final
kilometers take us around the bay, up and over the final hill and
descent into the resort. Mark's and my family are there
cheering for us -- shades of PBP. The hot tub finds us soaking
weary bodies and reminiscing. Semi-ah-moo is a wonderful resort
and everyone is very nice.</p>

<p>The following morning, Team Extreme arrive for the brunch
banquet. We share our stories and eat well. I cannot help but
think that this fl&egrave;che may be over, but were not finished.
Team Sunnyside shall ride Fl&egrave;che Pacifique in three weeks.
I'm excited!</p>

<p><center>April 15th and 16th, 2000</center></p>

<br>
<p><center>A ride report by Kent Peterson</center></p>

<p>On Easter weekend in France, randonneuring clubs ride in teams
from their respective towns to a common destination in sourthern
France for a banquet dinner. This event, known as a "fleche" from
the French word for arrow, has been adopted by randonneurs around
the world as an excuse to ride someplace and have a feast. The
rules of the fleche are as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Each team is limited to a maximum of five members and a
minimum of three members.</li>

<li>The ride must be completed in a 24 hour period.</li>

<li>The route must be defined, with checkpoints, in advance and
be at least 360 kilometers long. While a team may opt to define a
route longer than 360 kilometers, they must then complete at
least 80 percent of their proposed route and the completed
distance must be at least 360 kilometers.</li>

<li>At least 25 KM of the route must be completed between the
22nd and 24th hours of the ride.</li>

<li>At least three members of the team must complete the
fleche.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year it was decided that the finishing point for the
fleche would be Blaine, Washington and the celebratory meal would
be a Sunday brunch at the Semiahmoo Resort. I'd never ridden a
fleche before but when I started asking around, I found that Mark
Thomas, Peter McKay and Wayne Methner were a team this year and
yes, they'd be glad to have me join them. The only other team
signed up was "Team Extreme" consisting of Pete "The Bullet"
Bajema, Ken Carter and Bernard Comeau. Peter informed me that
our team was "Team Sunnyside". The name was a leftover from last 
year when the
fleche was held on the eastern (dry!) side of the Cascades. And
even though the forecast was calling for rain, Peter assured me
that "Sunnyside is an attitude thing, unrelated to the
weather!"</p>

<p>Team Sunnyside was going to start the ride at 6:00 PM Friday night at 
Mark's house in Redmond, ride north and then east to Darrington for a
brief break at a motel before returning west and then north again to
Blaine. The total proposed distance was scheduled to be 368 kilometers,
a relatively rational distance. In fact, it was a little too rational
for my tastes, so I had this crazy notion that maybe I'd ride back
down from Blaine on Sunday. Riding straight back looked like about
120 miles. That looked doable. I knew Pete Bajema lived up in Bellingham,
so I emailed him asking about a good route to ride back down. I knew Pete
wouldn't think my notion of riding back was too crazy.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Pete mailed me back encouraging words and suggested that I
take part of Team Extreme's route for the return trip. This is how I got
a look at their route sheet. While Team Sunnyside had come up with a route
that met the minimum distance plus a tiny bit, Team Extreme approached 
the problem from the other angle: how far could they possibly ride in 24 
hours and still finish? The result was a convoluted loop of a course
begining at the top of Snoqualmie Pass, heading up the Snoqualmie Valley,
doing a big loop out the North Cascades Highway and then South to
Darrington, then East all the way to Anacortes, then West again, up to
Bellingham and then angling around to Blaine. The total proposed distance:
547 kilometers.</p>

<p>"Wow," I thought, "Now that is nuts!" Since all of us who ride extreme
distances are used to having other people call us nuts, it's good to find
someone a bit further out there. Team Extreme was definitely out there.</p>

<p>It was the Thursday before the fleche that Pete relayed the news:
Bernie had injured himself training and would have to pull out. Team
Extreme was down to two riders and they'd need another person to meet
the minimum team requirement. Would I be willing to ride with Team
Extreme?</p>

<p>I didn't really even pause to think about it. The important thing
was to keep both teams in the running, so I jumped ship from Team
Sunnyside to Team Extreme. My lovely wife pointed out that "sunny" wasn't
one of the words she'd use to to describe me, but extreme was an
extemely good fit.</p>

<p>Friday night when the rain was coming down at 6:00 PM I was safe and
warm at home. Team Sunnyside was pulling out for a long dark, wet night of
riding while I went to bed early so I'd be ready when Pete and Ken picked
me up the next morning.</p>

<p>Early Saturday morning we piled in to Russ Carter's big Jeep. Russ, 
who is Ken's dad, would drive the support vehicle that we'd connect up 
with at certain control points along the route. Our ride would go from
7:00 AM Saturday to 7:00 AM Sunday with a possible sleep break at Pete's
house in Bellingham. By starting at the top of Snoqualmie Pass, we figured
we'd build up some decent speed to help with the overall average time.</p>

<p>It was 33 degrees and raining at the summit. Russ took a picture
of us bundled up in our rain gear and tights with a big snowbank as
a backdrop. At 7:00 AM, we pulled onto I-90 for the descent into
North Bend.
</p>

<p>The one degree of buffer was all we needed to keep the road from
icing and as we dropped, the temperature climbed to the upper thirties
and then into the forties. Luxury! We all had good gear and the rain wasn't
too heavy.</p>

<p>Since I was on my fixed gear bike, we'd agreed that we'd each ride at
our own pace for the descent. Pete and Ken on their carbon Treks with
bigger gears and the ability to coast could out descend me. My top speed
was limited by how fast I could turn the 70 inch gear on the PX-10.
Surprisingly I kept them in sight on the descent and by the time we
hit the exit at North Bend I was only about 30 seconds back. We regrouped
at the base of the exit ramp.</p>

<p>The area around North Bend, Snoqualmie, Fall City and Carnation is 
my home turf --
the places where I log lots of training miles. I was nice and warm from
the spin down from the pass and we kept up a good pace into Snoqualmie,
past the falls and at Fall City we turned north to follow SR-203 up to
Monroe.</p>

<p>It was around Carnation that I notice Pete and Ken were no longer
behind me. I figured one of them had flatted and at Duval I pulled over
to wait. I snacked on some granola bars and just as I was begining to
consider doubling back, they rolled in behind me. Sure enough, Pete
had flatted. We continued on.</p>

<p>We were going at a good clip, drafting on some sections. We all took
turns at the front, with Pete stretching out on the aerobars of his
Postal Service Trek. It had stopped raining now and the day was about
perfect for riding, overcast and not too hot or too cool. As we pulled
into the gas station that was our control point at Monroe, Ken flatted
his rear tire. Perfect timing!</p>

<p>We got our cards stamped and while Ken fixed his tire and Pete topped
out his tire with my pump, I did a few calulations. We reached this
control at 9:45 AM and my computer was showing the distance to be
88 kilometers with an average speed of 33.8 kph or 21 mph. Not a bad
start.</p>

<p>Ken and Pete were both impressed with my Topeak Road Morph pump, a
frame pump that turns into a tiny version of a floor pump. In the
course of our 15 minute break we got the tires all in good shape and
had time for a quick snack. Then we were headed East on Highway 2 and
then North on SR-9 heading for Sedro Wolley.</p>

<p>Somewhere along Route 9 we pulled into a small general store so
Ken and Pete could refill their water bottles. They were each running
with dual bottles while I was using a single bottle and a Camelbak. After
this brief stop, we were back on the road and at 1:23 PM, we pulled into
the control at Sedro Wolley.</p>

<p>Russ was here with the Jeep and we took a 12 minute break. I again
logged the stats: this stage had also been about 88 kilometers and
our average speed was 29.5 kph (18.3 mph). Russ told us he'd seen
Team Sunnyside earlier when they'd stopped here heading the other
direction.</p>

<p>From Sedro Wolley we headed East on SR-20 to Rockport. When the terrain
would climb, I'd tend to drop Pete and Ken. I'm a fairly light guy and
despite the fact that I was carrying a bit more gear than they were, it's
very hard to beat a fixed gear bike on a climb. On the descents, the balance
would shift the other way but we actually stayed pretty close together most
of the time. At Rockport, it had gotten a bit warmer and we all stopped
to adjust our clothing before heading South on SR-530 to Darrington.</p>

<p>We pulled into Darrington at 4:45 PM and took a 20 minute break before
heading West on SR-530. Our speed for this last leg was 27.2 kph (16.9 mph) 
for the 69 kilometers. Now we had a bit of a headwind but the riding 
was still quite pleasant. We pulled into the control at Stanwood at
7:42 PM and took a longer break (33 minutes) to eat and adjust our gear 
for night riding. The numbers for this 55 kilometer stage showed our
average at 23.4 kph (15.5 mph).</p>

<p>Now we rode through Conway and LaConner, a bit on Highway 20 and then
on some backroads along the bay. It was an odd scene with the giant
Anacortes refinery on our left making creaking mechanical noises, lit up
like a backdrop from BladeRunner with jets of vent gas burning
in the night. Above us the nearly full moon shone down and to our right
was a small strip of tidal beach was crowded with parked vans and campers
next to people sprawled in lawn chairs around driftwood fires.</p>

<p>At 10:45 PM we pulled into the control point at the Anacortes 
Safeway. We'd covered the last 55 kilometers at a pace of 23.4 kph
(14.5 mph). We took a 25 minute break and then headed back into the
night, backtracking along Highway 20. The temperature had cooled
back down to 47 degrees but we were still feeling pretty good.</p>

<p>Having just gone up a hill, I was ahead of the others by a bit
and as the road turned down, I was moving at a good clip. With
my Lumotec Oval Plus being driven off a Schmidt hub generator I had
the best lights of the team but even so when I saw the scrap of
two by six lumber gleam in my headlight beam, I didn't have time to
avoid it.</p>

<p>On a fixed gear bike, you don't unweight the bike like you would
a conventional bike. On a bike that coasts, you lock your pedals in
the horizontal position, flex your elbows and lift your butt off the
seat. On a fixed gear, you accelerate to unweight your saddle as you
bend your elbows. It's a reflex that's been drilled into me over thousands
of fixed gear kilometers. I punched the pedals and semi-levitated as the
PX-10 caught the board square in the wheels. No pinch flats, no wobble...
no problem!</p>

<p>We regrouped at the turn onto Bayview Edison Road and rode together
up to Chuckanut Drive. As we got closer to Bellingham, I said to Pete
"we're almost to your house, right?"</p>

<p>You know that saying "if you can't say something nice, don't say anything
at all?" Pete said nothing at all. It should've tipped me off.</p>

<p>We rolled into Bellingham and it seemed incredibly busy. People may tell you
that New York is the city that never sleeps but Bellingham at 1:00 AM on
an early Sunday morning is one happening place. Lots of kids walking and
driving around. Hadn't these people heard of sleep? We'd all heard of sleep
and were thinking it sounded like a mighty fine idea.</p>

<p>But first we had to get to Pete's. Ken and I weren't looking at the
route sheet, we were just following Pete. At every intersection that
we'd stop at if one road would go up, one road would go straight and one
road would go down, you could pretty much count on Pete turning onto the
one that went up.</p>

<p>And up...</p>

<p>And up...</p>

<p>I began to realize that Pete doesn't actually live in Bellingham. No,
Pete is a member of some cliff dwelling race who live in the mountains
above Bellingham. We rode up into the darkness.</p>

<p>Eventually Pete turns down(!) a side road and pulls up to a house.
"We're here," he announces simply. It's 2:10 AM. We stumble into Pete's
house, grab something to drink and settle in for a quick nap. Pete
tosses some clothes in the dryer. Somehow my warm gloves have vanished 
from my hands and I can't figure out what I've done with them. I managed to
log the stats, however. 64 kilometers for the latest leg with an average
speed of 21.7 kph (13.49 mph). Pete set an alarm and we all collapsed
on his floor</p>

<p>The alarm went off way too soon. Actually it went off at the time
Pete had set, but we agreed that that was too soon. It wasn't that
far to Nugents Corner and some extra sleep would make us that much faster
for the tail end of the ride. We went back to sleep.</p>

<p>When the stupid alarm went off again we had to get going. I still
could not find my warm gloves but I had my mesh short-fingered
cycling gloves and how cold could it possibly be? Ken put forth the
theory that at least we were done with the climbing and it was a
flat run to the end now.</p>

<p>Pete said nothing.</p>

<p>Ken pressed the point, "We're pretty much done with the hills now, right?"
</p>

<p>"Well, there's still some climbing..." Pete confessed.</p>

<p>I think Tenzing Norgay said something similar to Edmund Hillary while 
they were still hanging out at Lhasa.</p>

<p>The road went up. We went up. We kept going, knowing that eventually
we'd be descending. At one point we saw a bunch of flashing lights
ahead. As we drew closer we saw a tow truck and a couple of state
troopers working to pull a pickup out of the ditch. There was just
enough room for us to squeeze by.</p>

<p>When we finally got the descent, it came with a cold fog and truly
horrible road conditions. Since I had the best light, I was out front.
We were bouncing along as best we could when I saw the sign "Rough
Road". Just as I was thinking "well, duh!" the road surface changed
from bad to damn near non-existant. Huge craters opened in front of
us and we slowed and veered from one side of the road to the other
trying to pick our way among the few bits of pavement that still
clung to what the sign had mockingly called a road.</p>

<p>We knew we had no chance of making our full distance now. We were
going to fall about 50K short. This would still count using the 80%
rule but now we were into survival mode. We were making lousy time,
we couldn't see in the fog and it was really, really cold.</p>

<p>At Acme there are a set of railroad tracks that cross the road
at a sharp diagonal. I caught my front wheel on the fog slicked
tracks and went down. Fortunately I landed well and was already
numb enough from the cold that I didn't feel a thing. I eventually
got smart and wrapped the sleeves of my spare jersey over my fingers
which warmed my fingers slightly.</p>

<p>Road conditions improved tremendously once we were back on Highway 9
but we were too cold to care. Nugents Corner was the end for us. I held
out the hope that casinos are open all the time and that we'd have
someplace warm but it turns out that the casino there is closed from
5:00 AM to 8:00 AM on Sunday mornings and by golly there was just nothing
open at that hour. We did find the last guy who'd finished his shift
at the casino and asked him if he knew of any place that might be
open. He directed us to the Texaco down the street and we rode off.</p>

<p>The Texaco was closed but our new buddy saw that as he drove by and
stopped to offer us a lift. He had a pickup truck with room for three
bikes in the back and we all crammed in the cab. It was crowded, but it was
warm. We'd spent hours on cold lousy roads riding away from Bellingham
and now all that distance was being erased in one fast pickup ride.</p>

<p>The driver let us off at a 24 hour sports bar & grill in Bellingham.
Pete called his long suffering wife to come rescue us while Ken and I ordered
breakfast and coffee. We were nodding off and they told us we couldn't
sleep in the bar (they have an image to uphold!) so Ken stayed awake
by telling them the tale of how we'd come to be there.</p>

<p>I worked out the final numbers. My computer sensor had gotten knocked
off kilter when I went down on the tracks but it looks like the average
for the leg from Pete's house to Nugents Corner was a dismal 20.6 kph 
(12.8 mph). Overall distance for our 24 hour fleche was 499 kilometers
(310 miles) 
with an overall average speed of 27.6 kph (17.17 mph).</p>

<p>Back at Pete's we napped for a while and then Ken, Pete and I, the bikes 
and Pete's family all squeezed into Pete's van and we drove up to 
Semiahmoo. Here we had to put up with the good-natured ribbing of Team
Sunnyside who'd managed to ride the entire distance they'd said they
would. Mark Thomas dubbed us "Team Over-Promise and Under-Deliver." </p>

<p>Next year we'll go the distance!</p>

<p><center><b><a name="quote"></a>The Quotable Cyclist</b></center></p>

<p>For you fans of cycling literature in this issue we have a
brief excerpt from Dino Buzzati's book <b>The Giro d'Italia:
Coppi versus Bartali at the 1949 Tour of Italy</b>. This is from
chapter 23 entitled <b>The Old Racer's Refrain</b>. Enjoy!</p>

<p>The bicycle has two wheels, one that guides, the other that
runs; one obeys the brain when it comes to deciding whether to go
left or right, the other obeys the legs, our professionals' legs:
When you touch them, they shout out, "But this is wood!" and for
each leg there's a pedal.</p>

<p>The pedals! This is the cross we have to bear. Never, never
will they be satisfied: When one is up, its twin is down and each
one always wants to do what the other is doing: they continue to
run after one another and never, never catch up. Yet who can say
no to them? When one is up we push it down, then it's the other
one's turn, otherwise an injustice would be done. And the pedals
drive the chainwheels, the chainwheels pull the chain, the chain
pulls the cog, the cog turns the wheel, and the wheel carries us
forward, forward.</p>

<p>The legs! That's the big problem. Some people's are hard and
knotty, others' long and tapered like a ballerina's; one has
thighs like a hog's, another like those of a wading bird, but
they are all magnificent, strong, courageous, obedient. Our poor
legs! Miserable, enslaved, bruised, hairy, over-sensitive and
tired, they carry along, carry along this little piece of
machinery coarsely called life.</p>

<p>There are those who study, others, instead, who cultivate the
fields, or make clothing or pots, those who manufacture trains or
pumps; there are those who care for the sick, or bury the dead;
there are those who teach children, and others who say Mass. But
we do none of this: We do not manufacture or cultivate anything.
We move our legs, see, and nothing else. Absolutely nothing
else.</p>

<p>For this reason, we have been given an oddly colored jersey
and a number has been put on our back. Then they print our names
in the newspaper. They give us money, too, but for how long? They
throw flowers at us, love us, kiss us, ask for our autograph. But
for how long? Until the day, good people, that our legs say no.
They will say: Enough going around and around, pushing pedals up
and down. And without a number and a jersey we, too, will sit on
our doorstep, on these days in May and June, to watch other legs
turning; no longer ours, though. Ours will rest firmly on the
ground, like the legs of landowners, like those of pharmacists,
teachers, hat makers, plumbers, in sum, like all those who still
have all their faculties. And we will say: For us (thank
heavens!), no more backbreaking exertion, dust, torment; oh, oh,
and no more dysentery. We've had enough of that hellish life of a
convict! God, though, how wonderful it was!</p>

<B><P>Mar 18: 100 km Populaire</B> - Come join us for a preview of randonneur style riding. Regarding the route of the 100 k brevet, I thought we could start at the Redhook brewery, take the trail south, head over toward Snoqualmie Falls and back.
The Redhook Brewery is&nbsp; located in Sammamish Valley to the north of Redmond (I
think it has a Woodinville address).  It is located just off of the
Sammamish trail (that heads south to Marymoor Park).  We will have a route sheet.
We will start at 8:30 AM, so riders should plan an showing up around 8:00 AM to
allow time for registration. This should put us back at the brewery in the 12:30
to 1:30 range for lunch and a meeting. I'm planning to determine the exact route the weekend before the ride (March 11-12). -- Tom Lawrence, (206) 789-9271, tvlawrence@uswest.net</P>
<P>New this year will be a 100 km Pin with the following design:</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="100 km.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=250></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P>Thanks to Duane Wright for designing the pin and placing the orders. The pins will probably arrive just after the spring 100 km, but they should be just the thing to add to our medal collections. If you don't get one this spring, you can always ride the 100 km in September.</P>
<B><P>April 1: 200 km Brevet</B> - This will be a new southern route, starting from Kent. Greg Cox, (253) 639-2928, GregoryCox@compuserve.com</P>
<B><P>April 14-16: Fleche NW</B> - The Fleche is a 24 hour, team event, of at least 360 KM in distance and run similar to a brevet. Each team plans its own route with a common destination in mind. The Fleche is a fun event fostering friendships, teamwork and camaraderie during the planning, riding and finishing celebration of the accomplishment. Pete Bajema, (360) 671-5338,brahmabullet@netzero.net</P>
<B><P>May 13: 300 km Brevet</B> - A scenic ride up Whidbey Island, across Deception Pass, along Chuckanut Drive and Lake Samish, up to Lake Cavanaugh, and back to the Mukilteo ferry terminal via Granite Falls. Ken Carter, (425)255-6031, Kenneth.Carter2@PSS.Boeing.com</P>

<B><P>June 24: Cannonball</B> (275 miles) The Northwest's oldest (1985) cross-state one-day ultramarathon cycling event. The ride starts at the I-90 bike tunnel entrance in Seattle, WA, and uses the shoulder of I-90 for most of its 275-mile route, finishing in Spokane. Riders are expected to provide their own support, though we typically have at least one neutral support vehicle on the route.

<P>Does anyone has a copy of iGrafx Designer (by Micrografx )?</P>
<P>Vanessa (the artist who did the club jersey) used this for the SIR logo. Although I have some camera-ready copies of the logo, it would be much more useful if we could manipulate the electronic copy. The club has the rights to the logo (unlike the jersey design, which Vanessa holds the copyright for).</P>
<P>Two things I would like to do is get some rubber stamps for brevet controls, and get a couple of control signs with the logo as well. If anyone in the club has experience with that kind of graphic work and would know how to do this, that would be even better.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P><A NAME="justride"></A>It's not training, it's just riding</P>
</B><P>By Kent Peterson</P>
<P>There's a Danish proverb that states "the road to a friend's house is never long" and in that spirit I rode up to Port Townsend to see my friends Jon and Bob. Before Bob moved to Port Townsend last fall, he and I used to ride together a couple of times a month. I'd met Jon more recently. He's just getting into randonneuring and is going to be going on a cross country tour with his father this summer. By email we'd discussed his route and I had a set of Adventure Cycling maps he wanted to take a look at and a Brooks B17 saddle for him to try. I never figure a weekend is quite complete unless I log some bike time, so on Sunday February 27 I rolled out of my Issaquah driveway at 6:30 AM.</P>
<P>I'm riding my new old bike, a 1972 Peugeot PX-10E. I'd bought the frameset at the Seattle swap meet the week before and I'd built it up in the true Kent Peterson "don't you have any normal bikes?" style: 42 by 16 fixed gearing (coasting makes you weak!), Scott Drop-In bars, really classy coroplast fenders and enough tape to make Red Green envious. I've got the maps and saddle for Jon in my backpack along with some munchies for my journey.</P>
<P>I get to the Seattle ferry dock at 7:40 AM. Today is the day of the Chilly Hilly ride on Bainbridge Island, so there are hundreds of other cyclists taking this ferry. Lynne Vigesaa, Ron Lee and Peter McKay are riding Chilly Hilly so I chat with them on the ride over to Bainbridge. The ferry docks 8:30 AM and when the Chilly Hilly riders turn right, I keep going straight on Highway 305 across the island. At Poulsbo I turn off onto Little Valley Road which becomes Big Valley Road. Just before Four Corners I get to see what I'll always think of as Max's camel, a contented beast who shares a farm with a dromedary and some llamas. Max Maxon had been very pleased to see this camel a couple of years ago on the 300 K brevet and the camel still seems to be doing fine.</P>
<P>The day is beautiful and the threatened rain is proving to be an empty threat. The bike is working well except for my right pedal which has developed an annoying squeaking oscillation. I think it's a cracked bearing. I knew I should've switched my good pedals over from the Pinerello. Live and learn. I think this'll hold together until Port Townsend and I'll see if I can borrow some pedals from Jon or Bob for the ride home.</P>
<P>The sun is shining on the water as I roll across the Hood Canal bridge and I start climbing up 104. I turn off onto Beaver Valley Road and out into the farmland. I see a herd of bison and I roll on through Chimacum and on toward Port Townsend.</P>
<P>I'm making good time. I'd told the guys I'd meet them downtown at 1:00 PM but I know I'll be getting in early. It dawns on me that I've never been to either of their houses and that I'd cleverly left both their phone numbers and their respective addresses at home. Oh well, so much for planning.</P>
<P>By noon I'm in beautiful downtown Port Townsend, a town that's dangerously close to being too picturesque. I park my bike, wander around and stop in at William James Booksellers. It's hard to go wrong in a bookstore named after a philosopher and while I'm browsing around I find a book I'd heard about and wanted for a while, Gary Paulsen's <B>Pilgrimage on a Steel Ride</B>. Four dollars for a publisher's overstock hardcover tells me it's worth the weight in my pack to lug it home. Later, at home, I'll be proven right. A lot of what Gary has to say about his life and his Harley echoes in the miles I've ridden on a smaller, quieter steel ride.</P>
<P>A bit before one I meet up with Bob and we head over to the Tyler Street Coffee Shop for lunch of clam chowder and coffee. We leave a note on the bikes so Jon will find us and he joins us a few minutes later. We talk bikes and work and life and it's one of those simple afternoons when problems are small and can be solved with a little thought and just the right tools.</P>
<P>After lunch Jon and I head up the hill to his house and he loans me a nice old set of Suntour XC Pro pedals for the ride home. I fill my water bottles up, thank Jon for the loan and at 2:20 I head south out of town.</P>
<P>Riding a fixed gear bike on the open road is something that's hard to explain to folks who haven't done it. They see what you don't have, the gear options and the ability to coast and a lot of them can't quite fathom the why of a bike like this. On the ferry ride over I'd tried to explain it to Ron and Lynne but the words don't quite capture it. Like the saying "the map is not the terrain", talking about fixed gear riding will not tell you all there is to know about it. Only the riding does that and every ride is another lesson.</P>
<P>I've been riding fixed pretty much exclusively since the beginning of December and in that time I've logged some over 4,000 kilometers. I ride a 70 inch gear and I like it. I like that I have to be strong on the climbs and spin at 150+ RPMs on the descents. I like that when I get home I know I've turned the pedals for every centimeter of every kilometer I've covered. I like the fact that even when I come home tired, I come home happy.</P>
<P>It's three hours back to Bainbridge and without consulting the ferry schedule or relying on anything other than the sense of when to go and when to stop, I roll up to the 5:25 ferry just as they are loading the bikes. It's good to stop and park the bike and sit on the soft seat in the ferry and watch the sky grow dark and the lights of Seattle grow closer.</P>
<P>The ride back to Issaquah reminds me of my old commute and the bike climbs easily up the hill to the Mount Baker tunnel. I roll out over the bridge. My headlamp punches a small hole in the darkness, my bike flies through that hole and my tail light sews the fabric of the night back together with perfect red stitches.</P>
<P>Did I train today? Maybe, I did. My computer tells me I logged 212 kilometers at an average speed of 24.6 kph. My legs say "yeah that sounds about right" and my stomach says "what's there to eat around here?" But it's not training. I know a lot of guys who train. They train to do PBP or BMB or RAAM or some other big event. And sometimes I'm one of those guys. But today -- today I rode my bike. I saw my friends and I had fun. </P>
<P>And you know, I think I know why I train.</P>
<P>I train so I can have days like this.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P><A NAME="working"></A>Working out as a reason for working out.</P>
</B><P>By Mark VandeKamp</P>
<P>"This essay revolves around a workout that combined running and biking, but it could just as easily apply to a long bike ride. Hopefully it will resonate with some of you randonneurs." -- Mark VandeKamp</P>
<P>I did a workout last Sunday for no reason. It was a brick -- I rode about ten miles to Discovery park, ran two trail loops that made a little more than an eight mile run, and rode back home. I'm not training for a future race. I didn't do it hard enough to test myself or push my limits. I certainly didn't set any personal records with it. I wasn't really trying to lose weight or improve my health. I did it alone, so it wasn't a social event. It was a workout without any of those reasons, and it was exactly what I wanted it to be.</P>
<P>What was special about Sunday? Both nothing and everything. It was a crisp fall day without a cloud in the sky. Traffic was light. My legs were a little stale from my ride the day before, but mostly that just made a good reason not to push hard. Discovery park is always beautiful, with a mix of forest, sand bluff, and Puget Sound beach. Halfway through the first loop a bald eagle flew overhead. Later, along the beach I watched as dozens of small sailboats raced on the Sound, with the sun making their sails shine brilliantly white. It was a good day to be alive and moving, but the difference I'm trying to point out isn't about the outside, it's about the inside. Sunday was special because I was out there riding and running simply because I wanted to be out there.</P>
<P>Am I really being completely honest here? Are all the reasons I listed earlier completely irrelevant to me? In reality, many of them are relevant, at least indirectly. I like staying thin and feeling healthy. I may choose to run or ride in a race sometime in the next few months and will depend on workouts like Sundays in order to complete and enjoy it. I'm sure that I could think of other things that I get from working out, and they are all important. Still, I don't want them to be the reasons I get up off the couch and put on my gear. I enjoy myself less when my workouts are a means to those ends. The best workouts are the ones that I recognize to be an end in themselves.</P>
<P>I used to go hiking sometimes with a friend whose life was completely intertwined with climbing, hiking, and skiing. He would call me up on the phone and say, "Hey, do you want to go play tomorrow?" I used to think of it as just a quirky phrasing and shrugged it off. Now, I think he was using the language intentionally and truthfully. We were going to go play. My best workouts -- the ones that are an end in themselves -- the ones like Sundays brick -- are the times when I simply go out and play.</P>
<P>****************************************************</P>
<P>There are a lot of words above, and they are primarily my attempt to articulate an interpretation of the story below. Maybe it means something different to you. Maybe it will mean something different to me in the future. Whatever it means, I don't think its as trivial as it first appears.</P>
<P>(Copied from an un-attributed posting on the net)</P>
<P>A Zen teacher saw five of his students returning from the market, riding their bicycles. When they arrived at the monastery and had dismounted, the teacher asked the students, "Why are you riding your bicycles?"</P>
<P>The first student replied, "The bicycle is carrying the sack of potatoes. I am glad that I do not have to carry them on my back!" The teacher praised the first student, "You are a smart boy! When you grow old, you will not walk hunched over like I do."</P>
<P>The second student replied, "I love to watch the trees and fields pass by as I roll down the path!" The teacher commended the second student, "Your eyes are open, and you see the world."</P>
<P>The third student replied, "When I ride my bicycle, I am content to chant nam myoho renge kyo." The teacher gave praise to the third student, "Your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel."</P>
<P>The fourth student replied, "Riding my bicycle, I live in harmony with all sentient beings." The teacher was pleased, and said to the fourth student, "You are riding on the golden path of non-harming."</P>
<P>The fifth student replied, "I ride my bicycle to ride my bicycle." The teacher sat at the feet of the fifth student and said, "I am your student!"</P>

</B><P>(Note Jim is currently riding around with world on the Odyssey 2000 Ride)</P>
<P>Hello one and all and greetings again from another corner of the world...Africa!!! Cyclone Eline decided to do quite a number on Mozambique/Swaziland, but the gang is hanging in there and tolerating the mud, squeaky chains, and stinky clothes for a little while longer. We desperately needed our latest rest day in Durban!! </P>
<P>Our group depleted all the detergent in Durban, so we are still riding along the roads of Africa with "crunchy" socks and underpants (why is it that every e-mail I send out sooner or later comes back to the all-important topic of underpants?) I first washed all my clothes in my "dirty-laundry" bag (these are usually the little plastic bags from the grocery store, but this batch of dirty cloth appeared to be especially corrosive as evidenced by holes and tears spotted about the bag), but my big gear bag still reeked. Next, I washed my "clean" clothes. Still the stench emanated from within. Next, I washed all the stuff sacks and other bags inside my big gear bag. Wouldn't ya know it, PEE-YOO. Finally, I baby-powdered my running shoes, fumigated my hiking shoes, and left my biking shoes out in the sun for a bit. The original, horrifying odour is now gone, but there still seems to be a lingering waft which disallows my mind to let go of the memories of odiferous wastelands. My always-dripping-wet-tent is another interesting story. There is a patch about the size of a mouse pad on my front door which is growing an interesting kaleidoscope of bacteria. You should see the shadow it makes when I shine my headlamp through the tent: looks like Abe Lincoln's silhouette. I kid you not. I have contact dermatitis on both my knees; my epidemiologic skills determined the cause was kneeling on my wet tent floor the other night. Thank goodness I have some Triamcinolone in my armory...I'll show that bloody bacteria-virus-fungus thing who they're dealing with!!! (pharmacist humour).</P>
<P>Well, back to the wonderful trip I'm having. SA is an amazing country: it lacks the snow-capped peaks and volcanoes of Chile of which I'm so fond of, but it gives the eyes other wondrous pictures to spy on. The day of riding into Hazyview ranked up with my best rides of all time. What makes for a best ride of all time? I guess it is the whole "package." Last Friday's package included lack of mechanical problems; body, mind, and spirit 100%; ideal weather (tailwinds, mild temp, low-impact sun); great road conditions (smooth road, low traffic, nice shoulder); and lastly amazing scenery with mind-numbing descents. Wow, what a day!! Huge, majestic valleys carved out of the mountains appeared around almost every corner. Waterfalls were ubiquitous. The downhills were more of a rush than I could have ever imagined. My throat was sore that day from all the "woo-hooing" and "Yeah, baby!" and "Gosh-darn!!" -ing that I was doing. Yes, quite a day to remember.</P>
<P>All days seem to have their special memories. Some days its the perfect biking day. Some days it's one or two interactions from the locals. Other days it's an intimate moment with a friend. It's amazing how the little things seem to go so much farther when one is "on the road." No, I cannot ever see this trip becoming routine, and I'm starting to realize that this trip will reinforce my visions as seeing my "normal" life the same way. Full of changes, full of special moments, full of wonder and joy. Being surrounded by other cultures aids in this enhanced perception I'm experiencing, but I believe that this is only the catalyst for which already lied within me. Each day is a magical gift!!</P>
<P>Ahh, I tend to get carried away as I reflect on the days of the past. I'll give you a quick synopsis of the "goings-on" since I last wrote: Our flight to Jo-burg went off without a hitch. TK&amp;A contracted with the Prince of Qatar and his personal airline. We found out that the 747-200 plane WILL hold all our bikes, gear, and people (can't forget the people!). Yeah!! The Prince was also our pilot, and he was incredibly courteous and helpful throughout the flight. He enjoyed our company and RTW (Round The World) story so much that he invited us for a 2-4 day personal Camel Safari and tour in Qatar. Upon enthusiastic support from the O2K riders, TK&amp;A is looking into the schedule to see if this could be arranged. I must admit, I had to look up Qatar on the world map, and, after a couple hours, I found it sandwiched between United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Cool stuff, huh?</P>
<P>After a safe arrival in Jo-berg ~12pm (a 10 hour flight + we lost 5 hours), I biked over to a bike shop for bike shorts, new brake pads, and other essentials. Famished, our group ate every last strand of pasta at the Italian restaurant that night. Back to the road the next AM!!</P>
<P>Needless to say, we all felt a bit jet-lagged in the morning. Also, we were a little trepidatious with regards to safety in South Africa. Our radars were on full scan, but we eased up a little as we found that people here are very friendly, especially when greeted with a smile. We are up to 157,000 feet in total climbing on the bike, ~50,000 here in Africa alone. This means hilly, people!! The weather has been okay, the best day was the one I mentioned above. Other days have been mostly on/off downpours but relatively warm.</P>
<P>The other day I was having a perfectly normal conversation with another rider as we were pelted in the face by a virtual downpour. It was like the rain wasn't even there!! Our group loved our stay in Hazyview and Kruger Nat'l Park. I went on a one-day safari and was able to see elephants, rhinos, impalas, lions, giraffes, zebras, gnus (wildebeasts), and countless birds. The next 5 days were awesome as we entered Swaziland x 2 days and started getting into the coastal region. The landscape changed from forestry to sugarcane and other agriculture. I decided to "double-up" and ride into Durban a day early (170 miles) to have an extra rest day.</P>
<P>On Sunday, 3 other trekkers and I ran a 10K fun run along the beach (my time was ~43 min). After the run, we all frolicked in the Indian Ocean for a while, trying not to get too beaten up by the waves. This area of Durban reminds me of Miami Beach.</P>
<P>I like this city immensely, and have decided to take another rest day and do another double this Tuesday to catch up to the group in the evening. Durban is a diverse city with a melting-pot mix of culture. I am fascinated with the dynamics of Indian, Black, and White living in this town. There is much history here with the Anglo-Boer wars, Ghandi, and Zulu culture. As I mentioned before, books are not enough to describe the world: they leave too much for the imagination and are difficult to read without bias.</P>
<P>So... off to Cape Town!! This section of Africa is supposedly the most challenging, but consequently the most scenic (the charmed "Garden Route"). I'm glad to have this extra rest day for my legs: they're currently crying foul because of the 10K run yesterday. </P>
<P>Adios, amigos!!</P>
<P>Love,</P>
<P>Jim</P>

<P>Don't let the weather keep you from training! (Despite this lovely photo, we've had very good weather for the TerryZ training rides. Here's Terry's latest update)</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Barb.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=260></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></A>We continue to have great luck with weather and rider turnout, though looking at the forecast I suspect our luck may change this weekend. We had a dozen riders for a leisurely ride in the sun this past weekend. This weekend Wayne Methner is providing the route - we're going to venture out to the islands.</P>
<P>Important - the ride will still start at 9, but we have a ferry to catch at 8:40.</P>
<P>When: Saturday March 4th </P>
<P>TIME: leave at 9am as always, BUT catch the 8:40 Edmonds to Kingston Ferry. You need about $5.00 for the ferry.</P>
<P>Where: Start and End point is Kingston. To get to the Edmonds ferry terminal, take I-5 north from Seattle, take Hwy 104 (around Mountlake Terrace) west to the Ferry Terminal. If you reach the intersection with 405,you've gone too far.</P>
<P>Distance: 61 miles</P>
<P>Route: Depart Kingston to Port Gamble cross the Hood Canal Bridge, then Oak Bay Rd to Hadlock, a zig and zag to 4 corners. Return via Hwy 20, Eaglemount, Larson Lake Rd, Beaver Valley and Hwy 104 back across Hood Canal bridge.</P>
<P>On the way back, if you have a chance, stop at Kingston Cycle (I think it's still there). They have a marvelous collection of antique bikes, parts, and equipment.</P>
<P>Cue Sheet provided.</P>
<P>See you Saturday,</P>
<P>TerryZ (</FONT><A HREF="mailto: terryz@microsoft.com">terryz@microsoft.com</A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica">)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The ride on the weekend of March 11th and 12th will be 65 to 70 miles in length and will head south 
from Coulon Park. Ken Carter will be providing the route. As usual, Terry will send email a few days before 
giving more details and picking the day. If you 
want more info get in touch with Terry or Ken.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P><A NAME="TZ">Terry Z's Training Rides</A></P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Last year in January and February we had a fairly successful series of 7 rides in January and February as part of early season buildup before the brevets. I've had several inquires if the series would be run again this year. Because of the interest, I'd like to do it again.</P>
<P>The plan would be to meet one day per weekend between 8:30 and 9:30. The location and start time would be sent out early in the week. Last year we sort of stayed as a group, but did split up sometimes. The idea is to have a group to start with and depending on how you feel you can turn around early or add sections or your own. If it is desired to do these Audax style, we can try that approach as well.</P>
<P>The tentative plan for you is to start the last weekend of January (the 29/30) and do 7 weekend rides finishing March 11/12. This leaves the SIR 100 km on March 18 followed two weeks later by the SIR 200 km on April 1 (Fool's Day to be certain). If anyone really wants to start earlier, I'd consider starting January 8/9. The pattern will be a buildup of distance/time starting from the first week to the fourth week, on the 5th week we'd go back to a much shorter ride (take a break) and start increasing distance/time again. I will have photocopied maps this time.</P>
<P>I'd like to have rides that vary in location from Renton (south) to Arlington (north) to accommodate more people and for different riding areas. Perhaps we'll venture out to the islands (Whidbey and Bainbridge) as well. If anyone is interested in 'leading' a ride, let me know. 'Leading' will entail establishing the start time, the start location, and a route (preferably with a map).</P>
<P>*** Stepping up on Soap Box and turning into Fender Nazi ***</P>
<P>If you plan on riding with the group, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have fenders AND a mud guard. It's no fun finishing a ride with your daily supply of minerals supplied by the dirt and grit that's been sprayed on your face by those without fenders. If it's raining and you don't have fenders, don't be surprised if you're asked to either not ride with the group or sit at the back. Hopefully I won't need to send more mail about fenders like I did last year.</P></DIR>

<P>*** Stepping down now ***</P><DIR>

<P>Please pass this on to anyone else that might be interested.</P>
<P>Happy Riding!</P>

<P>First up, this is the headlamp I've been using for the past few months and I think it's a winner:</P>
</FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="duobelt.jpg" WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=440></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE>It's the Petzl Duo Belt and here's why I like it:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's French!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's got a separate battery pack which keeps most of the weight off my head. I got rid of the head strap and instead use a loop of velcro to secure it to my helmet. The battery pack rides in my pocket. There is a similar model called the Duo, which runs on 4 AA cells but I don't like it as well since the battery pack rides on your head and the battery life is lower.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's got both low and high beams with spare bulbs for each right inside the light. The low beam is good for reading your bike computer or a cue sheet and the focusable halogen high-beam (sorry I don't know the watts) is actually pretty good to ride by. I also have lights on the bike, but in a pinch this light will do the job. And it's great for helping you pick out road signs at 3:00 AM or when you have to change a flat on a dark and stormy night.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The light runs for a very long time on 4 C cell batteries. With alkaline batteries at 70 degrees, it's rated to go for about 10 hours on the high beam or 36 hours on the low. Of course, if you drop the temperature down to zero, the expectancies go down to about 9 hours on low and 3 on high, but that's still pretty good. For commuting, I'm running NiMH rechargeable batteries in the Petzl and I've been very pleased with the results.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You should be able to find the Petzl Duo Belt at various sporting goods stores for around $63. The last time I was in at REI, they had a whole bunch of them. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="Scott-dropin.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE>First off, even though they are technically aerobars, the French have approved them&nbsp;for use on Paris-Brest-Paris. Second, they really do offer a lot of usable hand positions. On long rides, this is very nice. Thirdly, the lower section of the bars is a great place to mount your lights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One downside to these bars is that I don't think you can make thumb shifters work with them. But if you are using lever shifters or down tube shifters, they'll be fine. And, of course, they also work great on a fixed gear bike, if you're into that sort of thing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
