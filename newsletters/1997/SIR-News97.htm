<CENTER><B>Heads Up on some Exciting News!</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A randonneuring friend, Bengt Sandborgh ,see his account
"The Great Ferry Race" in this issue, has made this proposal:&nbsp; "My
idea is for a friendship much like the exchange students programs.&nbsp;
My club (FREDRIKSHOFS I. F.) would invite your club (Seattle International
Randonneurs) to Stockholm where we would be your hosts.&nbsp; We could
take care of all your arrangements here, guide you in Stockholm, propose
cycling tours and brevets etc. etc..&nbsp; In another year you would do
the same for us when we come to Seattle."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Wow! how’s that sound?&nbsp; I for one am interested in
both going to Sweden and in hosting guests.&nbsp; At this stage it’s strictly
an idea with the details to be worked out but Bengt and I are anxious to
know who would be interested.&nbsp; This is not a commitment.&nbsp; Realistically,
with ’98 a qualifying year and PBP in ’99 it looks to happen in 2000.&nbsp;
Please let me know your thoughts and interest level.&nbsp; This is an excellent
opportunity to make new friends, expand your citizenship and experience
a most civilized culture.&nbsp; I hope to have a discussion at the next
GM.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; PS.&nbsp; And no language barriers.</FONT>

Larry and John agreed to examine it with a copy being included in the next
newsletter.&nbsp; A vote is expected at the January GM.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ernie spoke of two legislative initiatives that could
effect cycling.&nbsp; The first is that Washington State may require a
permit for bicycle racing, i.e. timed events on public roads, this should
not randonneuring.&nbsp; The other is a bill sponsored by Congressman Bud
Schuster from Pennsylvania banning bicycling on all federal highways.&nbsp;
Ernie suggested we write letters and make some calls to our elected officials
to protect our rights.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential new members attending were: Lynne Vigesaa, Debrah
Lowe, Bill Prichard and Joe Soy.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; Since the GM Terry Zmrhal has agreeded

<CENTER><A NAME="SBS"></A><B>Super Brevet Scandinavia or "The great ferry
race" or "Daylight 1200"</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>By Bengt Sandborgh - Stockholm, Sweden</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second edition of the SBS was held July 12 to 15.&nbsp;
Start in Fredrikshamn, Denmark and finish in Kristiansand, Norway, a +1200
km Brevet.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We where 45 starters most of which had chosen to do the
race in a co-operative fashion.&nbsp; That means we had: Pre-booked accommodation
after each day with dinner and breakfast.&nbsp; Baggage shuttle between
overnight places.&nbsp; Everyone re-started at the same time every morning.&nbsp;
But the Brevet was still according to ACP rules with a maximum time of
90 hours.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The first day (355 km) will go down in history as "The
big ferry race" as we had 3 ferry crossings.&nbsp; We where making very
good progress down the eastern coast of Jylland as we had a light tailwind.&nbsp;
The first two ferries were across narrow inlets on the coast (ride time
app.&nbsp; 15 min.&nbsp; each).&nbsp; Of course we manages to miss every
ferry with a couple of minutes.&nbsp; During the second waiting time we
had time to shop for food and refill our water.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When we came ashore from the second ferry we had, according
to the route sheet, 67 km to the next ferry.&nbsp; That ferry departed
every hour on the hour.&nbsp; If we rode the 67 km in 2 hours we could
make the 2 pm ferry.&nbsp; The av. speed so far was slightly over 35 kph
so it looked as we might would make it.&nbsp; But the route became more
hilly and we made a wrong turn in a village so the time was running out.&nbsp;
When we had made the 67 km we had 2 minutes to spare but here we found
out that the ferry terminal was another 4 km further.&nbsp; Foul language
and disappointment!&nbsp; But I said: Let's press on.&nbsp; It might be
delayed or something.&nbsp; When we saw the terminal the ferry was still
in and cars was driving aboard.&nbsp; At the check-in point our baggage
van was parked and the driver was inside the terminal.&nbsp; As he was
supposed to buy our tickets we assumed he had already done that so we rode
straight through.&nbsp; An official stopped us and told us to wait.&nbsp;
He talked a lot on his walkie-talkie and I heard he talked about cyclists.&nbsp;
Danish and Swedish is related but it's quite difficult to understand when
they are talking fast.&nbsp; After a while we got the impression that it
was OK for us to ride aboard and we went up the ramp.&nbsp; Someone was
shouting "stop, stop".&nbsp; But all 16 of us thought "Is he meaning me?&nbsp;
NO!" and rode on.&nbsp; Before we had stowed our bikes the ramp went up
and the ship sailed!&nbsp; A nice dinner in the restaurant during the crossing
(40 min) and we where beginning to feel good again.&nbsp; I don't think
I have ever ridden as hard as we did after the wrong turn when we where
trying to catch up lost time!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Safely ashore on the island of Sjalland we had 170 km
to Helsingor and the first overnight stop.&nbsp; As the time was only 3
pm we felt rather good about ourselves.&nbsp; Riders who had given their
best to catch the ferry was beginning to drop out of the group.&nbsp; We
arrived at the Helsingor Youth Hostel at 9.30 pm.&nbsp; Now we were only
5 guys in the first group.&nbsp; But where is the van?&nbsp; A phone call
to the drivers cell phone told us that he was delayed and was not due for
another hour.&nbsp; We took a shower anyway, who needs soap?&nbsp; After
dinner the van arrived, we changed and went to bed.&nbsp; It was not easy
to fall asleep.&nbsp; My heart was pounding and I was all keyed up.&nbsp;
355 km on 11 hours (running time) takes it's toll.&nbsp; I could hear the
soft clicking of riders arriving for a long time.&nbsp; During breakfast
the next morning we heard the full story of the chaos of the last ferry.&nbsp;
Because one of the two ferries servicing the route had broken down half
of the departures had been canceled.&nbsp; And as a result of this all
reservations had been annulled.&nbsp; We were indeed very lucky (and bold)
to have managed to get on the 2 pm ferry.&nbsp; The last riders had started
to ride the last leg 7 pm.&nbsp; One of our club mates had arrived 4 am
and she was not last.&nbsp; The van had not been able to get a place at
all and had to be driven a long way around to take another ferry.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>During breakfast one rider approached me and said: Don't
you have a red Cannondale? You have a flat front tire.&nbsp; I quickly
changed the tube and checked the tire for pieces of glass etc.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;
Strange, as it was clearly a piercing puncture.&nbsp; We started the second
day (319 km) by gently rolling down to the ferry terminal to catch the
7:11 am ferry to Helsingborg and Sweden.&nbsp; The boat ride is short (20
min), we are soon on our way to the first checkpoint.&nbsp; As usual the
group thinned out after the first hills and we were soon about the same
group as yesterday.&nbsp; The first control was at Hishult.&nbsp; A very
small village as it turned out.&nbsp; We were all looking for an open shop
or gas station to get our cards stamped.&nbsp; We saw a shop and turned
sharp right into a smaller road to get there.&nbsp; In the turn it felt
as my front fork was broken and I was sure I was going to crash.&nbsp;
I managed to stay upright and found out what the problem was.&nbsp; Front
tire puncture again! I gave my Brevetcard to one of my friends and fixed
the flat.&nbsp; The shop was closed so the card was finally signed by a
man who was having morning coffee with his family in his garden.&nbsp;
I pretty shure they where sick with crazy cyclists by the end of the day!&nbsp;
Now we where riding in Smaland.&nbsp; Lots of big woods and very far between
houses.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The group had by now thinned down to 8.&nbsp; One Dane,
one Frenchman, 2 Norwegians and 4 Swedes.&nbsp; We made up a great team,
everyone about the same strength.&nbsp; In the afternoon the route started
to get more hilly with several long dragging climbs.&nbsp; This surprised
me a little.&nbsp; It's amazing how harder hills get if you don't expect
them!&nbsp; Finally we arrived at the overnight checkpoint.&nbsp; First
again.&nbsp; Todays statistics: 319 km on 10.48 h (rolling).&nbsp; Rather
slow compared to yesterday but still ok.&nbsp; The dinner at a nearby restaurant
really tasted good.&nbsp; Before I went to bed I patched up my 2 spare
tubes.&nbsp; The 3rd day started with a really big breakfast at the same
restaurant as the day before.&nbsp; It's amazing how much food 40 hungry
Randonneurs can shovel in!&nbsp; Today we had 292 km to cope with.&nbsp;
The ride was rather uneventful, exept I had a third front flat!&nbsp; I
really should have bought a new front tire.&nbsp; In the afternoon we crossed
the border into Norway.&nbsp; The first checkpoint in Norway was at Halden.&nbsp;
We had a rather long rest at a gas station.&nbsp; The route sheet for the
Norwegian bit was very thorough, clearly written by someone who had test
ridden the route several time.&nbsp; It said "Long hard climb for 2 km
out of Halden".&nbsp; When we had almost made it to the top, Hakan cried
out "Hell!&nbsp; I left my Camelbak at the gas station!"&nbsp; Our laughter
followed him down the hill!&nbsp; In the evening we had a ferry crossing
again over the Fjord of Oslo.&nbsp; The final checkpoint for the day was
a Camping Park where several cabins had been booked.&nbsp; Todays statistics:
292 km on 9:49 h (rolling).&nbsp; The last day was rather different from
the first 3.&nbsp; Today we mostly rode on the heavily trafficated E18
road.&nbsp; On the first edition of SBS, the last day was on a Sunday.&nbsp;
Very much traffic with people going home from their country cottages.&nbsp;
This year it was Tuesday.&nbsp; Very heavy traffic with lorries.&nbsp;
I don't know which is best.&nbsp; Norway is the most mountainous of the
Scandinavian countries and we had several hard climbs during the day.&nbsp;
We also had the only rain for the whole Brevet, a small shower about 20
min.&nbsp; long.&nbsp; It was really good to reach the finish in Kristiansand.&nbsp;
We had 268 km and 9.38h for the day.&nbsp; For the total Brevet: 1235 km
on 41:16 h rolling.&nbsp; Total time 82:30 hours.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Super Brevet Scandinavia is a nice ride through 3 countries.&nbsp;
The flat farmlands of Denmark, the big forrests of Sweden and the mountains
and fjords of Norway.&nbsp; One problem with 3 countries is with the currencies,
your wallet soon begame a mess of different coins and bills.&nbsp; For
a Randonneur the "Euro", a common European currencie is a great idea!&nbsp;
The ride lacked perhaps an overall responsible person.&nbsp; Now one people
was responsible for each country.&nbsp; This can explain the lack of "marketing"
for this ride.&nbsp; The route sheet was clearly better for some parts
(i.e.&nbsp; Norway).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For you technically interested here is what I rode:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Frame: Cannondale 2.8</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Group: Shimano DuraAce 9-speed</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Gearing: 12/23 39/53</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Wheels: Hope hubs.&nbsp; Mavic Reflex rims, 32 DT Revolution
spokes, alloy nippels.&nbsp; Conti GrandPrix 23 mm</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Pedals: Shimano PD-747</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Shoes: Shimano SH-A100</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Handlebar: 3TTT Forma SL, Two layers of "Cork Ribbon"
tape</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Saddle: Turbomatic Titanium</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Lights: never needed!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The new Dura Ace group is a dream.&nbsp; It works flawlessly.&nbsp;
Shifts crisp and accurat every time.&nbsp; Several of the Campagnolo Ergopower
riders complained about sore right thumbs after the ride.&nbsp; The little
button you use to rear up-shifts is perhaps a little hard to push for so
long rides.</FONT>

<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>Biography of Bengt Sandborgh&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Bengt has been cycling for 17 years.&nbsp; It all started
when he and his wife to be bought 10-speeds and went on holiday to Scotland.&nbsp;
With little experience to draw on they each strapped on 40+ Lbs of camping
equipment and quickly found their low gear of 45X24 hardly enough, especially
when negotiating the Scottish highland.&nbsp; The trip was a great learning
experience and they never looked back.&nbsp; In 1988 Bengt entered the
"Vatternrundan", a 300 Km loop around Sweden’s second largest lake.&nbsp;
Initially the distance appeared formidable but accompanied by 14,000 other
entrants he found his niche.&nbsp; Looking for an even greater challenge
Bengt qualified for and entered PBP in 1995.&nbsp; Riding comfortably he
finished in 66h 44m and even slept 6.5 hrs the last night.&nbsp; Excited
about the next PBP he say’s in a couple of months you can ask "are you
coming to Paris next year?"&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Bengt is 39 years old.&nbsp; He and his wife have 2 children,
a son aged 9, a daughter aged 7 and a Golden Retriever.&nbsp; He lives
just outside Stockholm on the island of Lidingo and bicycle commutes 10
Km year round to his job as IS-manager for a firm of Civil Engineering
consultants.</FONT></TD>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Recently, while taking a computer programming class, the
instructor wrote two well worn phrases on the board.&nbsp; They were directed
at the activities immediately at hand and indirectly at life in general.&nbsp;
I feel the later is far more relevant and they bear repeating.&nbsp; They
are: "Just because you can doesn’t mean you should" and "Be carefull what
you ask for, you just may get it."</FONT>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER><A NAME="Spokesongs"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>"Spokesongs - Bicycle
Adventures on Three Continents," by Willie Weir</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Reviewed by Larry Ricker</FONT></B></CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>ISBN:&nbsp; 0-9656792-6-8; paper; 3 maps, 23 photos, 5
1/2 by 8 1/2, 144 pages, September, 1997.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The front cover grabs you with three color photographs
on a black background. One is of the author on a heavily-loaded, fat-tired
bike, grinding up a rock-strewn path (road??), fighting to keep the front
wheel in line.&nbsp; You might guess that the locale is one of the emptier
parts of Eastern Washington, but it's Rama's Gate, South Africa.&nbsp;
Another photo shows an urban street scene in Slovenia:&nbsp; festival posters
on a kiosk in the foreground, window shoppers in the background, and a
blurred image of an anonymous cyclist with a sport coat and a backpack
heading for an unknown destination.&nbsp; The third and most prominent
is of four little girls.&nbsp; Two are sucking on a finger in the universal
gesture of shyness.&nbsp; Another is very coy, an obvious flirt.&nbsp;
A tiny one smiles serenely.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These set the tone for the rest of the book, which is
a series of 59 "commentaries" written originally for KUOW, the Seattle
public radio station.&nbsp; They are short - none more than 2 pages, some
barely one.&nbsp; The author calls them&nbsp; "songs of the road," hence
the book's title.&nbsp; I see them rather as expertly composed, colorful,
word pictures.&nbsp; You can read them in any order, as few or as many
as you like, as if you were leafing through a photo album.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A few of the pictures capture the challenges of cycling
in exotic places.&nbsp; There is real danger, as in "Highway Robbery,"
where Weir and his cycling companion are clubbed and robbed by three bandits,
or "Ultimate Chewy Toy," in which Weir rides through a game park in South
Africa, not realizing that he's making himself attractive bait for free-roaming
lions.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>More often the subject is a friendly chance encounter.&nbsp;
Weir spends at least as much time off the bike as on, getting himself involved
in parties, weddings, meals, discussions, serenades, relishing whatever
the local social scene has to offer.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>An SIR member looking for ways to beat a personal best
in a 1200 km brevet won't find this book helpful, but it's written in the
true spirit of randonneuring.&nbsp; The main negative is that it's only
140 pages long, and there's plenty of white space, little character development.&nbsp;
A few hours and it's finished.&nbsp; In that sense the list price of $11.95
may seem a bit steep.&nbsp; On the other hand, it beats the price of a
ticket to Capetown, Calcutta, or Budapest.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The publisher offers a discount price of $9 each on group
purchases of 5 or more copies.&nbsp; I'd be happy to coordinate an SIR
order if there's enough interest, so if you'd like one or more copies,
let me know.&nbsp; Or order direct from the publisher:</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; When: April 5, 1998</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; Why:&nbsp; don't ask!&nbsp; . . . though the Paloose
is very pretty!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Course:&nbsp;&nbsp; Heads SW out of Pullman, dropping
down to the Snake river.&nbsp; Goes along the Snake river for about 17
miles, before climbing out of the canyon, exiting via a gravel road, climbing
about 6 miles, then continuing, mostly north back to Pullman through the
Paloose.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Categories:&nbsp;&nbsp; Solo and 6-10 member teams.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I did this run 2 years ago and had a lot of fun, though
the tank-top I received for participating is too large and I'd like to
go back a get a smaller size.&nbsp; For the team categories, the course
is partitioned into 10 legs, with the distance for each leg varying from
around 4 miles up to 9 miles.&nbsp; If you think you might be interested,
start running, and give me a call.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>John Wagner</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="image3.gif" HEIGHT=266 WIDTH=183></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Who is this Swedish beauty and what is she suggesting?</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For me Scandinavia is not so much about historical landmarks,
spectacular scenery or haute cuisine as it is a land of legends, equality,
civic pride, efficiency and beautiful women.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was the afternoon of August 23, 1995 day 3 of PBP.
I was in the process of selecting a juicy pastry at a boulangerie break
when this guy next to me asked "Do you needed water?" this was my introduction
to Ingvar of Sweden. We rode the rest of the day, finishing together and
have been friends since.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Christmas ’96, I received a package from Ingvar that included
an invitation to ride the "Super Brevet Scandinavia." A 1200 kilometer
(Km) brevet starting in Denmark, traversing Sweden and finishing in Norway,
details were sketchy but it looked enticing. The riding would be audax
style (in groups), with three nights of sleep at hostels and included dinner
and breakfast at each. The date was early July which at 60 degrees of latitude
meant about 19 hours of daylight and probably no night riding. Another
section referenced 6 different ferry crossings. I sent in my $232 registration
and notified Ingvar to expect a visitor.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Taking a page from expedition mountaineering practices
of trekking to base camp for local acclimatization and additional physical
conditioning I find it effective to prepare for a 1200 kilometer event
in a foreign country by bicycle touring for a couple weeks just prior to
the ride. Not only does this acclimate you to the culture it toughens the
butt and conditions the digestive to local fare. The plan was to fly into
Oslo, Norway’s capitol and cultural center, then cycle 600 km southeast
to Ingvar’s in Huskvarna, Sweden. Ingvar took care of the logistics of
getting to and from the brevet which entailed a combination of 3 ferries
and 300 Km of driving. I’d return home via Stockholm about 350 Km northeast
from Ingvar’s.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For 3 weeks prior to departure I watched, in horror, the
daily Scandinavian climatic forecast of rain. Armed with this information
I purchased a new rain jacket and crossed off taking sun block. On the
flight over I sat with a young lady from Portland, OR. She was going to
visit her sister who choose Oslo to raise children in a "social and civilized
environment." In the weeks following, most everything I experienced supported
this premise. In fact, a recent survey of 52 nations rated the Scandinavian
countries at the top of the index as the least corrupt. Arriving in Oslo
it was warm and sunny and remained so for the entire trip. Civilized, very
civilized.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In Oslo, my first destination was the Haraldsheim hostel
on the opposite side of town and just off my city map. It felt good to
be cycling on European roads again. I find them find far superior to ours
with smooth surfaces, no debris and courteous drivers who revere cyclists.
I quickly found the road system to be well organized with 3 "Ring" loops
numbered 1, 2, and 3 circling the city, each with a increasing greater
diameter. Each ring has a parallel bike/walking path with a maze of interconnecting
paths. I dare say Scandinavia has more kilometers of bike paths than roads
and to this end they are well utilized, doubling as ski trails in winter.
An added factor could be gasoline costing between $4 - $5 a gallon. Another
discovery was 1.) if I stood holding a map and looking lost no one would
stop to assist but if I asked for help it was always acknowledged and 2.)
9 out of 10 Scandinavians I met spoke nearly perfect English. Although
their occasional use of words left me scrambling for meaning, i.e. "accumulator"
instead of battery and "fetch" rather than attach. Something that always
made me smile was when I’d be wearing my "Magic Spoke" cycling jersey walking
around town, and out of a crowd I’d hear a voice said "Magic Spoke", they
love to practice their English.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For Scandinavians physical activity is more a way of life
than a hobby; consequently the females, the population I was most aware
of, were very trim and fit. Add fair complexion, blond hair, un-suspicious,
fun loving personalities and you are in very desirable surroundings. I
dedicated considerable time formulating these observations. Another charm
of Oslo are its many parks. The most famous, Vigeland Sculpture Park, was
my favorite. Filled with brass and granite statues created by Gustav Vigland’s
view of the humanistic life cycle, I call it Goddess Park for on a sunny
day the local females flocked here for unencumbered sun bathing. One morning,
on my way to visit the famous Homenkollen ski jump, built in 1892 and hosts
of the world’s oldest ski festival, I was getting hopelessly lost in Oslo’s
north hills. Stopping to ask a carpenter for directions, he motioned to
follow him as he got in his van and drove to the ski jump access road.
At the time I was awed by this act of courtesy but as my trip progressed
I found this civil attitude to be quite normal.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a tough decision to leave Oslo but my time was
finite and I had people to see and places to go. The first 125 Km of the
trip south was on the E6 bike path and not always easy to stay on coarse
due to the sheer number of intersecting trails. This turned out to be a
godsend for navigating practice, much of the brevet would use similar bike
paths. Along the way I stayed at hostels. They were conveniently located,
clean, inexpensive and served a great smorgasbord (the Brits. call it buffet)
breakfast. Meat, cheese, bread, herring, coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt,
fresh fruit and more. I ate it all, in quantities enough to last most of
the 150 Km I traveled each day. Cursing the herring in the afternoon, I
always went for it the next morning. One particularly memorable hostel
was run by Audrey, a most charming young lady. Located in a postcard setting
on the edge of Uddevalla bay. I could have stayed here for days. Carrying
about 25 lbs. of gear in 2 rear panniers, a rack pack and large soft back
pack, I was prepared for the worst and much of what I hauled about never
saw the light of day due to splendid 80 - 85 degree weather, thank you
gulf stream. Two things the Swedes have in abundance are trees and lakes,
both help moderate the temperature and make the riding pleasant. The national
colors should be blue and green not gold. At the request of a friend, I
stopped at the delightfully picturesque town of Trollhattan, home of SAAB
AG, and added another 15 lbs. of stuff from the SAAB museum gift shop onto
my already aching back Now only 200 Km from Ingvar’s on the south end of
lake Vattern, the second largest lake in Sweden, I was getting anxious
for our reunion.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Since I had called from Uddevalla, Ingvar was expecting
me. We met at the front gate of Husqvarna factory which consisted of a
half dozen multistory red brick buildings looking more like offices than
a manufacturing complex. He asked if I’d like a shower and ushered me to
the company exercise room. I noticed all the apparatus prominently displayed
the Husqvarna logo. When I asked about this he just chuckled. With the
brevet still a few day off I explored more of this beautiful area by bicycle
and Ingvar arranged for me to tour the Husqvarna works and the fascinating
museum. Originally founded at this location to make black powder and then
rifles in 1620, they have progressed through a multitude of high quality
machine products. Currently the core business is manufacturing top rated
chain saws, lawn mowers and trimmers. Ingvar and his wife Anita were extremely
gracious and I felt very comfortable in their home. For Scandinavians stability
is ingrained and they tend not to be very transient. Ingvar, for instance,
completed his education and works where he grew up. I’m not sure exactly
what Ingvar’s job is at Husqvarna other than a problem solver but he’s
fluent in 4 languages, is a pillar of knowledge and highly respected by
both customers and co-workers.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We’re heading to catch the ferry from Goteborg to Frederikshavn,
Denmark where the brevet starts. Our bikes are in the back of Ingvar’s
Volvo wagon, he knows this road well since it’s a regular brevet route.
At about half way we stop at a gas station/grocery they use for a control
and munch down a sandwich Anita packed for us. Ingvar would never consider
the distraction of eating while driving. At the ferry terminal 15 other
Swedish randonneurs are waiting. We’ll be taking a fast ferry which looks
to be designed for James Bond. It’s sleekness belies its size, which dwarf
our own Washington ferries. During the 1 1/2 hr excursion I’m introduced
to the other Swedish randonneurs but quickly forget who’s who with names
like Bengt, Gosta and Risto. Solveis is the lone woman registered. That
one’s easy. They appear to be from either the Stockholm or Goteborg clubs
and the excitement is high. Ingvar’s very pensive and not feeling well.
He’s suffering from nasty congestion and head cold he caught completing
recent 600 and 500 Km rides in pouring rain. He and Anita are scheduled
to leave for a holiday in Greece the day after we return from the 1200
and he’s not keen to jeopardize that trust. Where the French take the month
of August for holiday most of northern Europe take time in July.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In Frederikshavn we are put up in recently remodeled Danish
navel barracks. It’s like staying in a Holiday Inn, complete with satellite
TV. As soon as people settle in the Tour de France prolog can be heard
in every room. After dinner in the mess hall Johannes, the Danish organizer,
held a group meeting where he introduced each of the 44 participants, then
speaking Danish talked about bla... bla... bla. I couldn’t help notice
one Dane sucking madly on a cigarette and another puffing away on a pipe,
what kind of people are they? Peter, a 2 pack a day guy, is from Copenhagen
and turns out to be really nice. We ride most of the brevet together but
I never did get used to his lighting up at every stop sign. He claims he’s
quitting in 3 months, yea right Pete! Most look to be in their 40’s with
a couple old timers and all are lean and tough. Murdo, the only Brit.,
from Edinburgh, Scotland is the baby at 36. Klaus, the only German, is
very formidable looking in his lions main hair and Antoine, the only Frenchman,
rode with Ingvar and me on the last leg of PBP. The bicycles they ride
are very egalitarian, with a few hi-tech carbon fiber and titanium mounts.
A contingent of 6 Norwegians is due in on the morning ferry, then we can
start. They bring their own characters to the game, one rides in animal
skins, the Norwegian equivalent of Jeremiah Johnson and another goes nearly
naked. I keep waiting for the Viking horns to appear.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Brevet.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each of the 3 countries are responsible for their own
section of the brevet. That includes devising a route, printed material,
controls and overnight stop. The first day we cover 352 Km in Denmark -
Frederikshavn, in the north to Helsinger, in the south with 3,900 feet
of elevation gain (FEG) and 4 ferry crossings. Day two we start by ferrying
to Sweden and head north, finishing at Vargarda, with 319 Km and 4,500
FEG. Day 3 continues north in Sweden, crossing into Norway and finishing
on a ferry to Horten with 282 Km and 4,300 FEG. The last day we head southwest
to finish up at Kristiansand, Norway covering 262 Km and 8,000 FEG. Each
day the ends at a Hostel with an evening meal, shower and sleep. A smorgasbord
breakfast is served at 6 AM and we’re on the road by 7.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Danish section is on bike paths and I suspect anyone
without a Danish guide struggled to stay on course. Riding with a pack
of Swedes and Norwegians we "have nots" kept going astray or stopping to
ask directions. The joke was "10 kilometers and lost again." I lead in
the beginning but find it mentally tiring to correlate 12 character unpronounceable
names to our map while riding. The Danish countryside was flat and the
ever present power generating wind mills an ominous sign but the wind was
at our backs or from the side. I noted a number of new homes with classic
thatch roofs and asked why? It seems it’s a show of wealth, that you can
afford the outrageous insurance. I suggested that a Mercedes in the drive
might be a better choice.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Taking ferries on a brevet sounds romantic but an Achilles
heel appeared at the Ebeltoft 2 hr crossing. One of the two massive ferries
was out of commission and the schedule was backed up 3 hrs. On the more
popular crossings the demand exceeds ferry capacity during the summer months
so reservations for a specific time and date are required. On this day
reservations be damned, the ferry master was personally directing who would
load. It was looking grim so I encouraged Ingvar, who was pretty well disgusted
with this Danish operation so far, to slither up to the front and make
a break for it, asking for forgiveness rather than permission (viva America.)
Safely aboard we settled down to some serious smorgasbording in the dinning
room. With all the time lost getting lost we arrived at the hostel, about
1 AM. Sandwiches and drinks were waiting then a hot shower and sleep. Some
of our group stayed up talking and waiting for those who missed the ferry.
Tomorrow morning we take a ferry into Sweden and sanctuary.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Swedish terrain is rolling hills and country roads
no bicycle paths. I start out with the fast group, at 30 -35 kph, which
numbers about 25 and stay with them until the first control. They are a
lot more serious than the group I had been with but I came to ride with
Ingvar so waited here. Ingvar’s congestion is worse and he’s not enjoying
the ride. The Swedish organizer, Bengt-Goran from Goteborg, is with this
group and keeps the pace a respectable 25 -30 kph but he takes horrifically
long breaks, especially for lunch. This weights on Ingvar, a man of little
patience. When we arrive at the Hyltebruk control, a Pizzeria, Pizzas are
on the tables waiting for us, whoa! It seems Bengt-Goran called in an order
on his mobile phone while on route, what a guy. Riding in a group, taking
leisurely breaks with good food and getting a nights sleep seemed more
like touring with friends than riding a brevet. I could get used to this.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The next morning at breakfast, Ingvar announces he’s bagging
it. His cold has only gotten worse and at this point we’re only 100 Km
from Goteborg and his car. I ask to go with him but he insists I continue
with the brevet and call him when I finish so he can pick me up. I’ll miss
Ingvar. He’s a good friend and dependable companion. Our final day is in
Norway and it turns very hilly. The hills are short, none exceed a kilometer
but sometimes are very steep. It’s our shortest day but it’s going slowly.
Occasionally we’re on bike paths, deja’vu. At times when the group would
be conversing in native tongue all I could picture is the muppets’ Swedish
Chef speaking. Klaus, a middle school teacher from Hamburg, Germany, and
I conversed about his experience of just starting randonneuring this year
and plans to tour North America next year. Seattle is on his itinerary,
our new friendship will continue. It’s mid-day and for the first time the
sky looks threatening. As we pass a couple of bus shelters Bengt-Goran
motions to us to crowd into the shelters. A few minuets later the sky opens
up with a deluge of rain. After 20 minutes the sun comes out and we’re
on our way, none the worse. One habit I had trouble adjusting to is this
peeing in public thing they do. "They" appear to be totally at ease with
it, any time, any place. On one break a Swede was leaning against a post
box peeing when a car pulled up and an elderly lady gets out with a letter
in hand. As she approached the post box she notices this guy taking a wizz
and got so flustered she drove off forgetting to mail her letter. They
all had a good laugh but left quickly.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our last 50 Km was on the heavily traveled E18 highway
and got pretty stressful. We would just crawl up the hills and with little
to no shoulder; the traffic would crawl with us. A few of the monster trucks
voiced their annoyance with a toot of the horn when it was safe to pull
by; they must have been late for a ferry. We pulled into Kristiansand at
about 10:40 PM, just in time to hand over our control cards, swig some
Champagne and head for the night ferry to Hirtshals, Denmark. This slow
ferry is the size of a small ocean liner with all the amenities. Once on
board I showered and then on deck 5, found a soft spot on the hard floor
to nap. My well deserved dream sequence was rudely interrupted by this
dude sitting cross-legged and poking at my chest. As my eyes opened he
immediately introduced himself in perfect king’s English as someone from
Somalia. I guess he just wanted some one to talk with and I appeared to
be a captive audience. He eventually got the hint and left but not before
a group of drunken Danish revelers from the lounge came dancing by, hollering
at me to get up and party. Unknown to me, Johannes had reserved a $70 stateroom
in my name. He claimed he paged me but I was on the floor in la la land.
In the dining room at breakfast I met most of the returning Swedes and
Danes. Two Swedes, Carl and Kari, and I formed a pack to ride together
the remaining 50 Km to Frederikshavn and our last ferry back to Goteborg.
Carl, who is 58, was the first Scandinavian I noticed with any body piercing.
Looking at his navy tattoos I bet he earned his gold earring rounding the
cape, the original rite initiated by 17<SUP>th</SUP> century pirates. Using
Karl’s mobile phone, I called Ingvar from the ferry.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Back in Huskvarna, the task for me was getting to Stockholm
for my return flight 3 days hence. The buses recently stopped transporting
bicycles due to space constraints and the trains wanted up to a week’s
notice for large packages. The latter, was disappointing as I looked forward
to taking the high speed train since reading it rivals the French and Japanese
trains in speed (250 KPH) and comfort. If I bicycled, I’d have little room
for contingencies or time to explore Stockholm, the Venice of the north.
As usual Ingvar came to the rescue, air freighting my bike on his account.
We said our good-byes and in no way could I thank him enough for his hospitality.
He was off to Greece with Anita and I to Stockholm.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Stockholm is built on a archipelago connected by either
bridges or foot ferries. Buildings appear to rise from the water and mine
did. For the next couple of days I resided on the hostel ship Gustive Af
Klint (named for a historical Swedish naval hero) moored to the sea wall
across from Gamla Stan, 13<SUP>th</SUP> century old town Stockholm. The
location was perfect for exploring the historical inner city. My bunk was
situated next to a portal I could crack open at night feeling the sea breeze
or when exhausted from walking, lay gazing at the beautiful city framed
with sail boats. A real treat was sitting out on deck with dinner watching
the evening air show of 15 brightly colored hot air balloons drift in formation
over the city. One, with a massive gondola basket and sponsored by a restaurant
served dinner to it’s passengers while tethered in place at 1,000 feet.
How do you top that for an evening out or is it up? After maxing out on
museums I just walked through parks and obscure neighborhoods. I was greatly
impressed with the vast number of play areas. One park was hosting a boccie
tournament complete with live music and jumbotron to keep score. In another
people young and old competed at chess, less the music and scoreboard.
Roller skating half pipes and hockey rinks abound along with basketball
and tennis courts. Children’s areas were brightly colored and meticulously
kept. Dogs lay at their owners feet in restaurants and Pubs. What a wonderful
living city. Residence and tourists alike were out in force walking, talking
sitting and spending, some partied till well after the sun came up by the
sound of the live rock music at a nearby Pub.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I did experience 3 incidents that were unique in my cycling
career. In Oslo, while crossing an intersection a goon driving a BMW (yes,
they have a few) turned in front of me, grazing my front wheel and sending
me to the pavement. Pedestrians screamed in horror but neither by bike
or I were damaged, my helmet absorbing the impact. The second happened
late in the day as I entered Huskvarna on a bike path. After exiting a
underpass I failed to negotiate a sharp left. The combination of sand on
the corner, my vision adjusting to the bright light and the high weight
of my backpack sent me terra-firma bound. Tired from the days 150 Km trek
I instinctively stuck out my left hand to break the fall (bad dog), which
it did. This is good way to break your collar bone, which I didn’t. The
next morning my hand was swollen the size of a small grapefruit. Again
my helmet saved the day, less some whiplash and fortunately Mr. Hand functioned
well enough to get me through the up coming brevet. Numero 3 - day three
of the brevet. We were crossing a bridge in single file. I was the second
from the end and slowing for a turn when the last guy in line "star gazer"
crashed into me. Again fortune was on my side as I fell to the right and
on the guard rail. The other option falling left was less gracious and
into the traffic lane. The only damage other than some abrasions, sliced
open skin and bleeding was a broken rear wheel spoke and of coarse it was
on the drive line side. The group was wowed as I installed my emergency
Park kevlar string spoke and we were on our way in short order. Had the
accident been more serious the Park tool could be applied as a tourniquet.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The flight to Seattle was uneventful except when passing
over the Canadian Rockies. I couldn’t help notice the low snow level and
wondered if my friends who rode the Rocky Mountain 1200 had as marvelous
a time as I did?</FONT>

<CENTER><B>LAB DONATIONS??</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Members of the League of American Bicyclists just received
a solicitation for donations to reduce a budget deficit brought on by an
IRS ruling and some problems within their management. They have hired a
new executive director and seem to be going in a positive direction. I
would like the membership to consider having SIR make a donation in the
range of $50 to $100.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our Treasurer, Bill Dussler, projects a surplus of about
$800 at the end of the year. Next year we should be able to reduce our
membership and ride fees without cutting into this surplus significantly.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The LAB provides our insurance coverage (a real bargin)
and advocates for cyclists nationally.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A dissenting point of view holds that we should not reward
incompetence. I don't know much about the LAB's past performance. Perhaps
our funds would be better spent elsewhere.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you have an opinion on this one way or the other I'd
like to hear from you. If there seems to be significant support we will
vote on it at an upcoming meeting.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>SIR 600 km</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Tom Brett</FONT></B></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>We had 7 riders attempt this year's SIR 600 km,
with 5 of them completing the brevet. After some last minute course changes,
we had a 5 a.m. start in Snohomish, and a counterclockwise route over Stevens
Pass first, followed by a run up to Winthrop, and then a crossing over
Washington Pass and finish back in Snohomish. The Roddens were again very
generous in letting us park vehicles in front of their home and putting
up with all the early morning activities that these rides entail.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>Dave Johnson and Ken Carter, who rode the course
as a pre-ride on the weekend of 14 July, had a very good ride. They choose
a weekend that was rain-free! A most amazing feat this year! (But alas,
their good fortune didn't carry over to the RM1200). Dave and Ken "motored"
into Winthrop around 7 p.m. Saturday night, enjoyed a sit-down meal, and
then checked in to a motel for a good solid 6 hours of sleep (this is when
us slow folks really get envious!). They departed Winthrop around 4:30
a.m. and made the long haul over the North Cascades to the Newhalem control
in about 5 &frac12; hours on very empty stomachs. By the time they got
to Newhalem the rest of the world was up and they were able to replenish
their stores. The only disparaging words I heard from either Ken or Dave
regarding their ride was that "it clouded up a little on the final leg"!.
Geez! Don't say that very loud around Kendall, John, Ron, Don, or Ken Krichman!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These 5 intrepid souls ventured out the following weekend
and had to endure some of the heaviest rainfalls recorded in the State
this year. The ride started out under some very threatening skies. For
the most part though, the riders were able to get over Stevens Pass and
into Leavenworth without having to cope with a lot of water, at least not
a lot in reference to what was to come! From Leavenworth up to the Chelan
area it was just one humungous thunderstorm! At times the rain turned to
sleet or hail. The fruit crop south of Chelan was totaled and there were
reports of the Columbia being covered by ice (hail) at one point. And through
all of this, these guys kept riding! At one point John did seek shelter
at the McPollands but the worst of it was over by then. Around the time
that John was getting his mitts dried, Kendall found himself between two
storm fronts, and in trying to stay ahead of one, nearly overran the other!
(Kendall did overrun about a third of a Seattle based tour that was doing
a 4-day loop around the North Cascades. They were riding from Leavenworth
to Winthrop on Saturday. Some of us others ran into these guys later in
Winthrop and attempted to do some proselytizing. Maybe we will have some
new recruits next year!)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>By the time the riders neared Pateros, the skies started
to lighten and the roads were drying out. As they neared Winthrop, they
were treated to a very pretty sunset. There always seems to be an enticement
out there to keep you going after enduring those trying moments (that is,
if you have a mind, or the energy, to look for it!). In Winthrop we had
a BIG double wide, double long, trailer rented. It was about 2 blocks from
the Duck Brand saloon. So when these guys came rolling in we were able
to have BIG burritos waiting for them. These guys were also able to get
some serious snooze time. But when they woke around 3:30, two of them were
feeling the effects of the previous days labors. One of John's achilles
had swollen up during the break and with a pending trip to Scandinavia
and a 1200 km on the line, John choose to join the support crew. Ron was
presented with a sore knee when he awoke. This was something that had started
to develop as he had crossed Stevens Pass the day before. Ron elected to
"try it out" and did so all the way to the top of Washington Pass before
deciding also to join the support crew. (Ron also had a repeat planned
for the upcoming RM1200 to consider.) At this point we had 3 riders on
the road, and 3 "riders" in the pick-up truck. So what do you do when the
support crew equals the number of riders on the road? Head to the next
control and drink coffee and shoot the breeze! That was sure easy for us!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After the Newhalem control the "support" crew headed for
the barn, Kendall motored in solo, and Ron and Ken teamed up and finished
together - little did they know that they would be riding a good portion
of the RM1200 together!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Congratulations to Dave, Ken C., Kendall, Ken K, and Don
on their completion of this 600 km! And for all but the Doc, these individuals
all completed the SIR 1997 brevet series. Way to go guys! (The good Doctor
would have been in the group also, but he ran out of tubulars with less
than 20 miles to go on the 400 km. Hey Doc, any truth to the rumor that you
are going to get a calf tattoo to commemorate your accomplishments this
year - Rando super 5000 and RM1200?)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr. Don, or perhaps in this case, MR. DON, deserves special
recognition for his accomplishments this season. MR. DON completed his
first every rando series this year, and did so under some very trying conditions.
All but one of the scheduled brevets this year was marked by heavy rainfalls
and generally cold conditions. MR. DON persevered through all of them,
and then went up to Canada and finished very strongly in the RM1200! From
what I've heard, this ride had conditions that were worst and more prolonged
than any of the brevets! So a hearty hurrah for MR. DON! (p.s. were are
still tallying up all the flats per kilometer ratios so that due recognition
can be given in that quarter too!)</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Timberline Lodge ride and Club Critique ’97</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Ride Date: September 13 - 14, 1997</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Reservations ($) are currently being accepted. We need
a minimum of 8 and can accommodate 12. First come first serve, priority
to SIR members. The cost is $25 for a bed in the Timberline Lodge Chalet
room and sag from Hood River to the lodge. Payment guarantees a bed. The
actual cost may be less depending on group size. If we don’t get the requisite
minimum sign-ups by August 25th the reservation will be canceled and money
collected will be returned. Transportation from Seattle to Hood River,
OR and return, and meals are not included in the $25 cost. Ride sharing
is encouraged.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ride description: Start at the board head (colloquial
for wind surfer) capitol of north America, Hood River, OR. Meet at the
Hood River Hotel 9:30 AM for breakfast or be ready to roll by 10:30. The
climb to Timberline Lodge, at 6,000’ on Mt. Hood, is approximately 50 scenic
farm and forest miles. This route is much easier than any of our brevets
and remember what goes up goes down the next day. The sprint finish is
a nominal 8% grade, after which cold drinks, a hot shower and clean cloths
await you.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you haven’t been to Timberline before you’ll be hard
pressed on what to do after settling in. A few choices are: soaking in
a hot pool or swimming in a cool one -- both out doors -- examining the
beautifully constructed lodge and 1930’s period artwork, relaxing in the
lounge clutching a well deserved drink while peering up at the 11,000’
Mt. Hood summit or hiking above or below treeline. At some point we need
to critique SIR’s past season, see the May newsletter for details, and
formulate next year’s brevet dates along with who will assist in administering
the club and brevets. Dinner and buffet breakfast are in the lodge restaurant
are not to be missed.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Sunday’s return can descend directly to Hood River or
if the east wind goddess is resting, a beautiful 90 mile circuitous route
via Zigzag, Sandy and the Columbia Gorge is a cycling treat. Please call
John Wagner at 782-8965 to make arrangements for payment or if you have
further questions.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Here’s an article that was posted on the randon@cycling.org
mailing list that I though you all might enjoy. It first appeared in the
AUK magazine <U>Arrivee</U> a year or two back. Reprinted with permission
of the author of course.</FONT></I>
<CENTER><B>Reflections of a Lanterne Rouge</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>by Lynn Goerings-Nayle</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the aspects of the ethos of AUK which appeals to
me, and, I am sure, to many others, is that speed is of little importance.
There is no distinction between those who dash round a 200 at near evens
and those of us who trundle back to the event HQ up to six hours later.
We are all recognized as having done the ride, and are all entitled to
buy the self-same medal and claim the same number of points (if we're into
that sort of thing).Many of us (me included) gasp in awe of those who can
finish the Elenith or the Brevet Cymru in daylight, ride the Great Eastern
in two days, or stop in mid-Wales for full B &amp; B on the way back from
Anglesey. It must be marvelous to be so fit. But aren't these legends of
the road perhaps missing out on something? Might not there be something
to be said for spending weekends at a more leisurely pace? Well, dear reader,
I have spent many a long hour ensconced on my Brooks pondering this question,
and at last I can bring you the results of my musings.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>What is it, you ask, which makes a rider gravitate to
the back of the bunch? For my own part, I am sure it is a natural talent
for being slow. No matter how hard I try, that is where I end up at the
end of the day (or well into the next day sometimes). Using the latest
titanium components makes no difference. Doubling my effort makes me twice
as knackered, but still leaves me firmly at the back of the field. Others,
though, have to put in an enormous effort to remain behind the rest. One
notable example has to go to extraordinary lengths to handicap himself
and suppress his natural speed - including consumption of vast amounts
of alcohol, welding bits of old railway line to his trike, and carrying
enough spares to build a complete bike. On two wheels he goes like the
clappers.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Some habitual speed merchants occasionally choose to see
how the other half lives. I recall a Brian Chapman Memorial a few years
ago, when Ray Haswell, certainly nobody's slouch, made a titanic effort
to overcome his natural speed, and was one of the last to leave each control.
He even managed a few hours B &amp; B somewhere in North Wales. Part of
his tactics included two giant banana splits with chocolate sauce at the
Tre'Ddol control.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In contrast, many is the speed merchant has made the mistake
of zooming round a ride, only to realize at the finish that his team-mate
who is giving him a lift is still several hours from the finish. Not only
that, but the kit-bag with the dry clothing is locked in his car and the
keys are also several hours from the finish in the saddlebag of the aforementioned
travelling companion.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I need hardy remind you, dear reader, that there will
be a huge advantage for the more sedate rider in the recently announced
Banana Skin Spotting competition.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>An important consideration for everyone, in these days
of belt-tightening and austerity, is the matter of money. Let us take a
simple example. A elementary calculation will reveal that someone riding
the Windsor-Chester-Windsor at 27 kph will be frittering away his or her
4 pound entry fee at a rate of 17.763 pence per hour, while the more stately
among us, arriving back at HQ, with half an hour to spare, will be expending
at a rate of 10.126 pence an hour. That amounts to a clear profit of 7.637
pence an hour! I will leave it for you to consider the total for a Super
Randonneur series. And just think of the fortune to be made from a Brevet
5000!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Many riders begin their Audax careers by riding shorter
randonnees and progressing to longer and longer distances, getting fitter
and more confident as they do so, and completing the distances in ever
shorter times. Eventually, they can confidently complete even the longest
distances well inside the time limit. They become blase - the rides no
longer present a challenge. Or, as is often said in controls as the last
riders prepare to leave, "Any fool can do these rides if he's fit, the
real challenge is when you're completely UNfit."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Every four years the numbers of riders in all events swells
as they do their PBP qualifying rides, culminating with a flat-out 600.
They keep up their impressive mileage and strict diets until late August,
perhaps doing a 24-hour, a York Arrow and a clutch of permanents. Then,
taking into account the advice of previous participants, they ride the
PBP itself, usually with hours, if not days, to spare. Now, I ask you,
what sort of a challenge is that?</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Here's what you should do: ride the bare minimum of qualifiers,
then switch to a diet of chocolate cake, chips, and cherryade for eight
weeks, chucking your bike into the furthest recesses of your garage and
forgetting it entirely. Then, once in Paris, acclimatize with plenty of
late nights and red wine. It helps, if starting at 10.00 p.m., to spend
the day riding into the centre of Paris and standing about in the heat
of the day. On no account should you take it easy and rest. Only with such
careful preparation can you call it a real challenge, and get a genuine
sense of satisfaction, of achievement against all the odds, when you finish
the 1200 km with ten minutes to spare.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not expect my thoughts as set out above to change
anyone's riding habits, and it is unlikely that we will see crowds of accountants
and pot-hunters fighting to be the last out of cafes, but I hope you will
see that there is more to this game than fast times, fitness, and personal
bests.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>Kendall and Larry's 300 km Adventure</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>by Larry Ricker</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On May 17, the official date for SIR's 300 km brevet,
Kendall Demaree was otherwise engaged, and Larry Ricker set his alarm clock
for 5:15 AM but forgot to turn it on, waking up at 6:30 as the ferry to
Winslow full of intrepid randonneurs was pulling away from the dock.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When John contacted a disappointed Larry on the following
Monday to arrange delivery of the brevet cards, Larry asked about the possibility
of a makeup. John thought it would be OK, and included three unused brevet
cards and a route sheet along with the documents from the official day.
Larry then sent out a "fool wanted" call by e-mail asking for someone to
go along on either the Saturday or Sunday of the Memorial Day weekend.
Tom Brett nibbled tentatively, but had already done the ride on the official
day and his bike was a bit worse for wear. After further consideration,
he sent his regrets on Friday morning. Larry figured he'd be riding alone,
but just as he was giving up hope, Kendall answered the call. They agreed
to go for it on Sunday.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was overcast and cool but calm as they rolled off the
Winslow ferry. The clouds never really went away, but it never really rained
either. Kendall took the lead, where he was to remain for 99.9% of the
time. As they cruised toward the first control, they discussed their goals
for the ride. Both really wanted to make it in before dark, which meant
finishing in about 14 hours, the median time for the original group. Given
the difficulty of the stretch from Bear Creek to Bangor, and Larry's recent
200 km performance (over 10 hours including the infamous detour up "the
other Cherry Valley Road"), the 12H09 time posted by the fastest riders,
Ken Carter and Rick Hippe, seemed like a remote possibility at best.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>But with Kendall pulling and Larry doing his best to hang
on - not always succeeding - they cruised into the Quilcene control (at
the 75 km mark) in 2.5 hours, then into Union, the halfway point, with
an elapsed time of 5H20. Twelve hours suddenly seemed tantalizingly doable.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Larry fueled up, wolfing most of a plate of lasagna in
10 minutes. Kendall had a slice of pizza and the leftover lasagna. It was
about 50% cheese, 40% meat, and 10% pasta. Consequently, the leg to the
next control was one of the low points of the ride, but those greasy calories
were to come in handy later on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once they passed the state park on the Belfair-Tahuya
road, the cars disappeared. It turned out that a small slide had closed
the road just east of Tahuya. Fortunately, the closure was easy to circumvent
on bikes. Then came the 20 mile rough-road challenge through the woods.
It was fun at first -- quiet, cool, no cars. At about the 5-mile mark they
rounded a corner and surprised a small black bear, which crashed off into
the brush. It got old after that though. After plenty of grinding ascents
and bone-rattling descents, they were grateful to reach smooth pavement,
despite the nasty hill around the next corner. Larry struggled up that,
but his morale came back on the fast run down to Seabeck, which they reached
at 5 PM.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>They were about 30 miles from the finish, with the Anderson
Hill yet to come. Kendall suggested that they could take it easy the rest
of the way in, but Larry figured he didn't really mean it. There were subtle
hints, such as when Larry walked over to the porta-potty for a quick one
and came out to find Kendall standing there holding both bikes, ready to
roll.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When they got to the Anderson Hill, Larry put it in low
and ascended at about 5 mph, barely fast enough to keep his bike upright.
Kendall was waiting patiently at the top. That behind them, and with Kendall
seeming just as energetic as ever, they agreed to shoot for a 12H finish.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The final hour was a blur. With smooth roads, little wind,
the drafting effect of the constant stream of cars, trucks, and motor homes
roaring by at 60 mph, Kendall down on the aerobars, and the "heading for
the barn" phenomenon keeping Larry from blowing up, they rolled into the
ferry terminal in a total of 12H01. Fate was kind. The waiting ferry had
just loaded the last cars but still had room for two more bikes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In retrospect, Larry learned some important lessons about
going fast. First, get a faster rider who is willing to pull the whole
way. Second, avoid mechanical problems and flats (tires lined with Mr.
Tuffys, etc.). Third, minimize time off the bike by eating on the move.
Total time for all stops, including the four intermediate controls, traffic
lights, etc., was 48 minutes. Not exactly a relaxing randonnee, but the
next day was a holiday...</FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>The Cache Creek 600 km. June 7&amp;8.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>Pitt Meadows - Cache Creek - Pitt Meadows</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Simplicity</B>: The cue sheet is pretty simple. Head
east on highway 7, turn left at highway 1, turn around at Cache Creek.
Makes the cue sheet for most 200 km brevets look like a Tolstoy tome, by
comparison.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Usual <B>apprehension</B>, at the starting line. Good
to have Harold and Tim turn out to encourage us on our way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Heightened apprehension</B>, at the starting line,
due to the threatening skies.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>And they're off</B>! Eight of us departed Pitt Meadows
at 6:00 a.m. Four others had left the previous day. Eight more would depart
in an hour. Lots of flexibility!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Appreciation </B>at falling in with Karen, Larry and
Lauren (sp?).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Heightened apprehension</B>, by Mission, due to skies
that turned out to be more than just talk.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>More heightened apprehension</B>, when we came out
of the Sea Bird Island Caf&eacute; and felt cold.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Relief</B>, when Hope brought us hope (i.e. it stopped
raining, once and for all).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Apprehension</B>, as we got onto highway 1, from being
infected with Karen's concerns about the seven tunnels.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Apprehension </B>when a truck pulled very close to
Larry and me.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Relief </B>that I'd had the good sense to put the
triplizer on the retro bike!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Slight concern </B>when I could no longer keep up
with the gang.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Challenge </B>to know how much to wear. It was hot
on the climbs and cool on the descents. And the Fraser Canyon was certainly
hilly!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>That's entertainment</B>! There was a vintage car
rally and a chopper motorcycle rally taking place somewhere along the route,
so lots of older cars were to be seen, and way too many motorcycles were
to be heard.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Satisfaction </B>at reaching Spence's Bridge. Appreciation
when Karen said we should dump whatever we didn't need for the ride out
to Cache Creek and back. Good thing not everyone was as brain dead as me!
Here highway 1 leaves the Fraser River Canyon and follows the Thompson
River Canyon.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Agony </B>from some of the hills on the last leg,
out to Cache Creek.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Amusement </B>taking a break from the focus of a brevet
to meet a friend at the restaurant, in Cache Creek, and try to squeeze
in an intense, albeit often delightfully humorous, conversation.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Excitement </B>seeing the riders who arrived an hour
after us arrive at the restaurant, in Cache Creek, while we were still
there.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Excitement </B>heading back toward Spence's Bridge,
as the sun was setting. I'd assured the gang that it was o.k. to not wait
for me. I knew I was a slow poke and I didn't mind being out on the highway
alone, at night.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Excitement </B>seeing Doug and Susan, on their tandem,
descending into Cache Creek.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Excitement </B>phoning Martha, from a phone booth
in Ashcroft, and, while talking, noticing a sliver of a crescent moon setting
behind the mountains.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Magic </B>and <B>wonder </B>as night fell and the
stars came out in the canyon. I thought that if I hadn't been so brain
dead, if I hadn't needed to get to sleep (and damn soon), if I hadn't needed
to get up at some ungodly hour and do another 250 k, it would have been
nice to just spend the night out in the canyon. But, the faculties were
fading quickly, so I didn't dwell on that one.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Amusement </B>at a bike light that seemed to stay
behind me for quite some time, then suddenly made a rapid acceleration
when we had a very slight downhill. I knew this could only be one thing
- the tandem!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Relief </B>that my lights all were working fine. The
current arrangement was an evolution of the slightly less than satisfying
Rube Goldberg arrangement on the fleche.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Sizable relief </B>at arriving in Spence's Bridge.
Joy at seeing lots of beds in our room ... though, I would have had NO
trouble falling asleep on the floor!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Euphoria </B>when taking a shower! Life can be good.</FONT>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Sleep. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Big relief</B>. I heard Larry up and about and so
I sat up in bed (not TOO painful). Then he told me he had only got up to
go to the bathroom and we could go back to sleep for another 40 minutes.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Ouch!</B> Alarm goes off at 4:00 a.m. Well, I didn't
feel too badly, though I had apprehensions because I could still remember
the major bonk, last year, riding from Spence's Bridge to Boston Bar, for
breakfast. I ate my stale onion bagel and a third of a power bar. The gang
cautioned me to NOT fill my water bottles with the local stuff but Lauren
offered me some sweet juice drink, which I gladly accepted. Larry and Lauren
commented on the loud motorcycles and fireworks, during the night. Karen
and I hadn't heard a thing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Bonksville. Ugh</B>. We were all suffering on the
hills, even though, over all, we were descending. At one point, at 5:00
a.m, with no traffic and with two lanes in our direction, a long, fast
moving truck came over slightly onto the shoulder. I noted that the gang
gave him the thumbs down sign. How civilized, these Canadians. If I had
thought he would have noticed I would have given him some other sort of
sign.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Sheer, unrelenting agony</B>. Twice I had to get off,
on the hills. I couldn't do much walking, in Look cleats, but I simply
couldn't pedal anymore. There was no steam in the boilers.</FONT>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>How do you spell R*E*L*I*E*F?</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>B*O*S*T*O*N**B*A*R!!!!!!!!!!!!!</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I was born again, from breakfast. Again, lots of fun
when the 7:00 a.m. Saturday departees arrived. There was a group of Ross,
Dierdre, Ken (?) and Manfred.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The gang of four was back on the road. Well, soon the
gang of three was climbing toward Hells Gate (probably so called because
it's pure hell getting up the thing) a ways off in front of me. I entered
the first of the seven tunnels. It was a curved tunnel - the worst! I'd
almost made it through when a truck came roaring up, from behind. He didn't
move over, probably due to the curve (he'd have no idea if he could take
the on-coming lane). As he entered the tunnel he hit his air horn - in
case I couldn't hear this roar! Just as he was on top of me he hit the
horn again and nearly pierced my ear drum!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Relief</B> at reaching Hells Gate. Relief at getting
through the twin tunnels, near the top, with little traffic (and NO trucks!).
Oh what a feeling. I came out of a tunnel RIGHT BEFORE a huge platoon of
vehicles (incl. trucks and RVs) came through. Timing - it's everything.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Oh joy, oh rapture </B>- not going to stay long at
this "control." I countered that this wasn't a control but she'd have none
of it. She pointed out that earlier in the ride she'd been put in charge
of cracking the whip!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Surprise </B>- and lots of testosterone. Just as we
pulled out of the 7-11 we say the now gang of three coming. We all fell
in together and you could feel the adrenaline. Several of us took strong
pulls before the pace line disintegrated. Eventually the gang of three
became the gang of two, as Karen and Lauren pulled off the front. As they
moved away Manfred commented that they probably felt the need to move more
quickly because they had started an hour before. I "thanked him" for reminding
*me* of that! Ross and I were chatting, as we all became more social in
the last few kilometers. He mentioned that he was retired. Wow. How do
these guys do it? Maybe I'm too young for this stuff!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Peace</B>. We finished! The store even had <B>ice
cream</B> bars!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I jumped in the car and headed south. I made it to the
rest area, south of Bellingham, before having to sleep. Two and a half
hours later I was awaken by the loud idling of a truck cab. It was time
to get out of there. In traditional randonneuring magic, that sleep had
completely restored me and I quickly finished the remaining drive to Seattle.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Timberline Lodge ride and Club Critique ’97</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Ride Date: September 13 - 14, 1997</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Reservations ($) are currently being accepted. We need
a minimum of 8 and can accommodate 12. First come first serve, priority
to SIR members. The cost is $25 for a bed in the Timberline Lodge Chalet
room and sag from Hood River to the lodge. Payment guarantees a bed. The
actual cost may be less depending on group size. If we don’t get the requisite
minimum sign-ups by August 25th the reservation will be canceled and money
collected will be returned. Transportation from Seattle to Hood River,
OR and return, and meals are not included in the $25 cost. Ride sharing
is encouraged.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ride description: Start at the board head (colloquial
for wind surfer) capitol of north America, Hood River, OR. Meet at the
Hood River Hotel 9:30 AM for breakfast or be ready to roll by 10:30. The
climb to Timberline Lodge, at 6,000’ on Mt. Hood, is approximately 50 scenic
farm and forest miles. This route is much easier than any of our brevets
and remember what goes up goes down the next day. The sprint finish is
a nominal 8% grade, after which cold drinks, a hot shower and clean cloths
await you.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you haven’t been to Timberline before you’ll be hard
pressed on what to do after settling in. A few choices are: soaking in
a hot pool or swimming in a cool one -- both out doors -- examining the
beautifully constructed lodge and 1930’s period artwork, relaxing in the
lounge clutching a well deserved drink while peering up at the 11,000’
Mt. Hood summit or hiking above or below treeline. At some point we need
to critique SIR’s past season, see the May newsletter for details, and
formulate next year’s brevet dates along with who will assist in administering
the club and brevets. Dinner and buffet breakfast are in the lodge restaurant
are not to be missed.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Sunday’s return can descend directly to Hood River or
if the east wind goddess is resting, a beautiful 90 mile circuitous route
via Zigzag, Sandy and the Columbia Gorge is a cycling treat. Please call
John Wagner at 782-8965 to make arrangements for payment or if you have
further questions.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Night Fright</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>by Larry Ricker</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As I packed the rain gear for the 400 km brevet, my wife
begged me not to go. Well, OK, she didn't beg, but she made it clear that
she wasn't comfortable with the idea of riding on busy highways at night
in the rain. I patiently explained that we'd be very careful, had lights,
good shoulders to ride on, etc., etc., but she wasn't convinced.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I arrived at Paul Fredrich's house at 3:45 AM after fumbling
around trying to find it, even though I'd been there before. An omen? But
the weather was "not too bad" and the group enthusiastic. We left on time
at 4 AM.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I stayed with the lead pack for a while, but I was feeling
the effects of the 300 km makeup with Kendall Demaree the weekend before,
and gradually dropped off the pace. By the time we turned away from Lake
Sammamish I was riding alone, trying to find a comfortable rhythm. The
sun actually came out for a second or two in Carnation, but as I made the
turn for Monroe I could see dense gray clouds massed to the north. First
it was light rain with the feeble sunlight still strong enough to cast
a rainbow in the middle of a cow pasture to the east. Then the big drops
were beating on the pavement. I had only gone 50 km of the 400 and was
already soaked. Great!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>By the time I pulled into the Monroe control at 75 km
it had eased up a bit, but only a bit. Seeing several other dripping randonneurs,
and walking through the puddles they'd made on the floor of the mini-mart
didn't do much to cheer me up. John Wagner suggested that I ride with someone,
but I wasn't in a very social mood. I decided to stop at a restaurant to
reconsider over some pancakes. It was about the last intelligent thing
I did.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A little food and hot coffee can do wonders, and this
time was no exception. Several determined-looking riders rolled by as I
ate and watched. One (Ron Himschoot, I think) waved to me through the window
as if he were having a good time. I decided to go a little farther.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A few miles up the road I noticed that one of the guys
who had just passed was talking to someone on the phone. It was Greg Cox,
apparently wiser than I, calling it a day.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A few miles farther and I caught Ron and Don Harkleroad.
It wasn't hard; they were stationary. Don was fixing a flat, his second
or third of the day, with many more to come. We rode together from there
on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Fast forward now, past the bowl of lukewarm chili in Skykomish,
the tiring but satisfying climb over Stevens in cold drizzle, past the
thrilling descent through Tumwater Canyon with real sunshine and the river
roaring through the rapids, past the break at the control in Leavenworth
where we hooked up with Bill Dussler and consumed enormous sub sandwiches,
past the long grind on US 97 with John Enzweiler offering encouragement
and cokes at the summit, past innumerable breakdowns and delays with Don
somehow keeping himself from throwing his rear tire (if not the whole bike)
off a cliff in disgust. It's 9 PM, and we've just rolled out of the Cle
Elum Safeway. I'm a little bummed after watching Ron and Don devour a bag
of jo-jos and another bag of chicken strips -- each -- with very satisfied
expressions. My meal choice (non-fat pasta) had been clearly inferior.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It's getting dark. We pull onto I-90, climbing toward
the pass. Soon it's raining and getting colder. Hordes of semis, motor
homes and cars are blasting by us, raising a gritty mist, fogging our glasses.
My light is working intermittently at best (batteries not well secured
in their holder). Unfortunately, good vision is critical because the shoulder
we're on is full of potholes, tire chunks, wood, large rocks, muffler parts,
drainage grates -- everything but smashed bikes, and I expect to see one
of those soon. I'm thinking, "This is crazy, really crazy." The climbs
are OK, at least I feel like I'm in control, but the descents are another
story. The wet, black pavement soaks up the light. Unless the debris is
a contrasting color, it's invisible. I hit several large objects with no
warning, almost falling. I start to slow down. The other three are either
much more confident or are seeing a lot better because it doesn't seem
to faze them. Soon their tail lights are out of sight.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Now I remember something Ron had said about wanting to
get through a snow shed in daylight. Soon I'm finding out why. I roll up
to the entrance and stop. No shoulder, pitch dark, still plenty of traffic.
I'm wearing a large reflective triangle and have a blinking rear light,
but figure that by the time a truck driver saw me it would be too late
unless he had a clear lane to move into. Not a comforting thought.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I wait for a break in the traffic. Finally there's a short
one, and I go for it. As I pull out for a sprint (or what passes for one
at that point), I see a car in my mirror. It's coming around the corner
fast in my lane. I try to move to the right to get out of the way and hit
a crack or some debris. The bike almost goes down in front of the oncoming
traffic. I unclip my right foot and somehow maneuver onto the pile of sand
that has accumulated along the edge of the right-hand lane. The car passes
as I stand there holding my bike with my back pressed against the tunnel
wall.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Breathing hard, I wait for another break and for my hands
to stop shaking. I get back on and pedal, not looking back this time, finally
out the other end and dodging rocks to reach the shoulder. I can see the
lights of the pass ahead now, but it's too late. I'm still fine physically,
but I've had it mentally. I can't imagine making the long descent to North
Bend safely.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I finally catch up to my group, which is taking advantage
of the yellow cone of light at an exit ramp to put on more rain gear. I
explain that I'm quitting. They aren't. I ride the last 2 miles up to the
pass on the dark, quiet frontage road, check into the motel, call my wife
(who is very relieved), take a shower, wake up six hours later to more
pouring rain, call my wife again. Two hours later we're heading home in
the car.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It's sunny in Issaquah when I stop at Paul's house to
pick up my other car. I learn that Don and Ron finished at the 24-hour
mark, but Bill had two flats in quick succession and took an offer of a
ride in from North Bend. I learn that Rick Hippe had fallen near the beginning
of the ride. I remember hitting a big transition in the pavement (caused
by repaving) at about the same location. It was dark then, too. No other
injuries. It could have been a lot worse.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We need to reconsider this route. John Wagner has suggested
starting in Monroe. That would be better. Even with all of my group's delays,
we'd have made it through the major climbs and descents in daylight. But
let's face it, I-90 is a drag at best, no matter when you're riding it.
Ken Brooker's route last year was less difficult (only one pass), but much
safer, with very little traffic. The last leg was along the Columbia, which
was fine in the dark. Maybe there are other possibilities closer to home.
Meanwhile, the descent from Stevens with the US 2 traffic on the 600 km
is looking much less appealing to me.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Hello.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>British Columbia cyclists said goodbye today to a great
Randonneur, truly one of those who fully earned the capital "R" in the
word. The memorial service for John Hathaway, who recently died of cancer
at the age of 72, was attended by about 50 of his friends, amongst them
(in spite of a record-setting downpour) about 20 or 30 cyclists who made
the journey to pay our last respects to a man who inspired several generations
of riders who came into contact with him. A sizeable bunch of the bikies
were in the Procession of Honour organized by Bruce Hainer of the Vancouver
Bicycle Club.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I was very honoured to have been asked to help as an usher,
and was delighted to be able to greet his (and my) old and new riding mates,
folks from the local bicycle industry, and friends of the family. Among
the attendees were the other three B.C. cyclists who, with John, made up
the first successful Canadian team at Paris-Brest-Paris (1979): Dan McGuire,
Wayne Phillips and yours truly.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Harold Bridge, now Vice-President of the Randonneur sector
of Cycling B.C., spoke from the heart and stirred many a memory with his
stories of the John we all knew and admired. Harold, still fit and keen
at 70, cycled over from a far suburb of Vancouver, B.C. bringing along
over a dozen of John's medals and other memorabilia.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A tandem riding partner of John's from the 1980s, Peg
Mercer, literally blew us away with a stirring a-capella rendition of "Amazing
Grace".</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If there were tears, they were certainly of joy: the joy
of knowing we had all been touched by John's unique and unforgettable personality
and spirit, and also of knowing he was now out of pain and in a safe place.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At the reception, messages received by e-mail and fax
from people who could not attend, among them Jennifer Wise, current President
of the Brevets Randonneurs Mondiaux, Robert Lepertel, the first President
and guiding light of the BRM, and webmaster extraordinaire Johnny Bertrand
were read in part, and a scrapbook was circulated.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Special thanks go to the hard-working volunteers who helped
organize the service: Harold, Bietta Harritz (co-executor of the estate,
along with Harold), and former Vancouver Bicycle Club president Henry Hulbert,
who truly took John under his wing when he needed a helping hand in the
tough final weeks of his life.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The celebration became truly joyous with adjournment to
a local eatery, where many more stories of our good friend were swapped
and savored.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>John: you would have loved it had you been there... but
come to think of it, you were--in our hearts!</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Here’s an idea! How about a fall 200 km over here on the
Eastern Washington side? We can make an "official" brevet or just a fun
social ride. In a recent RCC newsletter, Prez Ron Himschoot suggested not
giving out maps so you fast folks have to stay with the folks who know
where the ride goes. Sounds good to me! Any interest? Give me an e-mail
at merlin@televar.com or a call at 509-886-1166. Laura</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Thanks to Larry, Duane and John for their ride stories
and articles. I’m sure with the 600 km and STP next month I should have even
more from everyone else. Happy riding!</FONT>

Km. Eventually all teams converge for a group banquet, this years destination
was at Harrison Hot Springs (HHS.)</FONT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Two weeks until the Fleche - I just read Bob’s e-mail describing
the horror of a face plant when your front skewer breaks. A veteran of
PBP, I couldn’t imagine a little thing like knocking out 4 teeth stopping
this guy from riding the Fleche.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One and a half weeks until the Fleche - "My Left Foot"
swelled up without warning or reason to the point I could barely walk.
My doctor just said "duh!" The good news was pedaling felt therapeutic.
Four days of ice and elevation got things under control.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One week until the Fleche - Harold Bridge, B. C. Fleche
director, called informing me that our first and last legs’ stated distance
was not the shortest possible route, consequently reducing our overall
distance below the required minimum. I was not so upset that this segment
which we’ve been using for the past 5 years was in question as I was over
the late notice to add more kilometers.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Day of the ride - The ride went almost boringly according
to plan, with only casual excitement when Larry’s rear tire blew-out at
5 AM Sunday. We hit each control within 10 minutes of our original estimate,
working hard at not falling behind schedule. At the start the weather changed
from a drizzle to sunshine and blue sky. About the time the team was congratulating
me for summoning up such splendid weather the head winds started, by Sumas
it was pouring rain. With the wet roads Ken, the only member without fenders,
was sent to the back. We never saw a shadow again until approaching the
finish. Our team covered 419 Km and availed ourselves a comfy 5 hour motel
break Saturday evening. With 9 other teams entered this year, you expect
to cross paths. We had time for only a wave, when passing in opposite directions
on SR 9 the Kendall, Dan Wood and Ken Carter team, who were on their award
winning 630 Km journey.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Finishing Sunday morning we merited a soak in HHS pool
before the awards banquet where you switched to endurance eating at the
best $16 buffet in the northwest. This banquet has to be a big looser for
the HHS hotel when 38 hungry cyclists descend on their dinning room, I
easily consumed my entry fee with just the red meat coarse. It’s always
a pleasure meeting and eating with the friendly BCR’s. This year they distributed
a first edition Fleche Pacifica lapel pin. I caught Dan between trips to
the buffet table and asked if he was still on for our pre-riding the 300
Km next week, he responded "Only if we ride slow."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A rewarding time was had by all on top of Tom and Ken
qualifying for Super Randonneur 5000. Bob will be after knocking off a
1000 Km this July. They are the 5th, 6th and then 7th Americans to achieve
this honor.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>May 17th 300 Km Tour Tahuya Brevet</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>John Wagner</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once again the Olympic peninsula provided the setting
for a scenic and challenging SIR brevet and what a difference a little
sunshine makes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 11 riders participating in this years 300 Km brevet
were blessed with 55 - 65 degree temperatures, little wind and mostly blue
sky. It looked a little threatening over Mt. Walker but the cloud cover
worked to cool off the climb. Two broken spokes and a broken rear derailleur
cable were the only anomalies and barely slowed the guys down.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Dan and his companion Suzanne provided large doses of
encouragement and support at designated controls and the finish. The tough
three tier Anderson Hill became a little more challenging for Rick when
his rear derailleur cable snapped on the last grade putting him in a 42
X 13 gear for the steepest section. At the top a quick thinking Bill, using
his RPI acumen, jammed a two bit piece into the parallelogram, providing
Rick a more usable gear for the remaining 35 kilometers to the finish.
Speaking of Bill, whenever I saw the lead group he was usually up front
pushing the pace on his shiny Colnago.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ken C. rode strong but objected to the numbingly rough
surface on Dewatto Rd. Tom was with the lead group until he broke a spoke
on the scenic Dewatto section. Tom’s buddy Dr. Ken was chasing most of
the day until the Seabeck control when lack of sleep the night before and
too little caloric intake finally took it’s toll. By the way Ken, was that
a hacksaw blade I saw in your pocket?</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>John looked his normal thundering self until Seabeck.
By this point the gravity of the accumulated elevation gain had -how you
say - "slam dunked" him. Davie wasn’t far behind, his extra credit miles
were the difference.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Wayne, the most senior rider by a long shot, continued
to ride impressively. Relatively new to cycling, he initiated himself with
the 200 last month and finished the 300 in fine style.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At the finish Ron and Don looked as fresh as they did
at the start, confirming that pacing your speed and eating/drinking before
you "need to" pays dividends. Duane looked to be in similarly good shape
but admitted to be "laughing on the outside but crying on the inside."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Congratulations to each finisher for a safe and successful
event. A special thanks to Dan and Suzanne for a full day of support.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>SIR 600 km - June 21, 1997</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>Tom Brett</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 600 km is scheduled to start on 6/21/97 at 4am. It will
be a clockwise loop over the North Cascades, down through Winthrop, Wenatchee,
and then over Stevens Pass. The start/finish location is still up in the
air. The traditional location has been in the city of Snohomish. Have been
considering moving the start/finish up to Arlington. The chief reason for
this is to enable the riders to be better positioned to get over Stevens
Pass on Sunday before traffic builds up too much. A draw back to the Arlington
start/finish is that the fast riders could have a long haul from Leavenworth
to perhaps Gold Bar without any services - in the middle of the night,
but I could set up a control at Stevens Pass for them. If we had an Arlington
start/finish, I would arrange for a motel around Cashmere (roughly the
250 mile mark). I would like to know how many riders are planning to do
this ride, and what there preferences are for the start/finish location.</FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>"Destined to be a classic"</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The new and improved SIR 300 Km brevet is a variation
of an old favorite, the Hood Canal 200 Km. An extension at Belfair takes
you on a scenic tour of Tahuya and points north.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The start and end is at the Bainbridge Island ferry terminal
on Bainbridge Island. Entry paper work will be handled during the half
hour ferry excursion from Seattle.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The route follows SR 305 north to SR 3, to SR 104 crossing
the Hood Canal, then turning south on SR 101. Shortly after Potlatch you
head east on SR 106 before turning onto the old Belfair Hwy. at Belfair.
Here a short out and back insures the required overall distance is met.
Now for the fun part. SR 300 takes you west to Tahuya. A series of scenic
back roads meander north to Holly, Seabeck, and Bangor. At this point your
hankering for the easy return via SR 3 north and 305 south to an awaiting
Washington state ferry to whisk you home.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>You will experience some of our states most spectacular
vistas and terrific cycling roads but there are no free miles on this one.
The first 180 Km you climb about 4,000ft the next 85 Km you pick off another
4,000ft. The good news is the last 35 Km are relativity flat with a downhill
finish, yippee! This route is a test, enjoy it and revel in your accomplishment.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Brevet start time: 7 AM</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Location: Bainbridge Island ferry terminal parking lot.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Time limit: 20 hours to complete this brevet.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Brevet cost: $15 for SIR members.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirements: Working regulation lights (front &amp;
rear) and reflective garments. They will be checked and monitored.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Recommendations: Start riding hills now, please make sure
your bicycle is in excellent working order for parts of this route are
very rural. Fenders are encouraged - aerobars are scorned and a proper
randonneuring attitude is essential.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our ferry leaves at 6:20 AM from the downtown Coleman
Dock for Bainbridge Island. Street Parking is available south of the ferry
terminal. Please allow sufficient time to catch this ferry, if you miss
it you miss the brevet.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR is now on the Web. E-mail members, you will find the
newsletters posted there at about the same time they are mailed out, I’ll
send you a brief note to let you know the new newsletter there.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Some of the areas are still non-functional, but please
check it out and pass on any constructive criticism you have to offer.
Anything else you’d like to see on our web page? Let me know. We update
it at least once a month, curiously about the same time we upload the current
month’s newsletter.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Planned additions include a "Links" page to other Randonneuring
Sites (including International Randonneurs and BC Randonneurs) and a Calendar
page for SIR rides, as well as brevets scheduled by our neighbors north
and south should an SIR date conflict with something else on your calendar.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Clarification of March Meeting Minutes</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>John Wagner</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Pertaining to a suggestion I made for a end of season
ride to Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon. Other than having a terrific
ride and social weekend my intent was to use the over night stay at this
magnificent setting for a year end SIR business meeting. The agenda might
include a review of what SIR did this year, i.e. brevet routes, after ride
socializing, newsletter content, general meetings and what if any improvements
can be made for next year. Nominations for the 1998 board positions and
brevet organizers should be addressed and 1998 brevet dates need to be
set, having them ready for Syracuse in November. The adage "failing to
plan is planning to fail" looms, so please contribute and volunteer. Your
suggestions and input are valued, whether you attend or not. The date I’m
planning for is September 13 - 14, let me know if that works. Please contact
Laura, Larry or me with your input. I’d like to see a living list of your
input to this agenda appear in the newsletter each month. Thanks, your
contributions make SIR what it is.</FONT>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>HOOD RIVER TO TIMBERLINE</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 10 person bunk room has been reserved at Timberline
Lodge for the evening of September 13. The cost per person will be $20
- $25 for room and sag. Sign up is on a first come basis, I am now accepting
deposits now. We need a minimum of 8 for this ride.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second topic is the SIR jersey. We need someone to
take on this activity. It entails coming up with a design(s), contacting
a number of jersey vendors and collecting price and delivery information,
getting SIR approval for the design and unit cost, then soliciting members
who want to purchase (pre-paid) before placing an order. This jersey is
not necessarily targeted for PBP; in fact it would be nice to come up with
a SIR logo to be used on future designs. Anyone with ideas or interested
in pursuing this activity please contact me at 782-8965. If you want a
club jersey we need a volunteer.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>Hell of a Week - Part II</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Are We There Yet!</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>John Wagner</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Texas highways are straight and made for speed. That’s
good since we’re hankering to get the hell out of Dodge. Our first day’s
destination, the mile high town of Fort Davis, is about 400 miles west.
Along the way we had time to stop and explore the spooky Caverns of Sonora,
and an Ozona double burrito lunch. By Alpine, Greg and Rick were eager
to ride the remaining 26 miles in the dry warm mountain air. After checking
into our motel, Beall, Pat, and I rode out to meet them, just as they approached
this old west rustic town.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For me, the next days ride was worth the coming to Texas.
After discussing whether to do the climbing first or last we headed out
on the 80 mile "Davis Mountains Loop" with the McDonald observatory at
6,700 feet our first stop. Passing a sign banning motor homes, you know
serious suffering lies ahead. The grand vista from the observatory was
speculator during daylight and I imagined viewing our galaxy at night.
I believe Greg said it took him 43 seconds to descend the bump I took 20
minutes to climb. The rest of loop was fast rolling high desert hills.
Later we got to practice our echelon technique before turning the corner
for an downwind 25 mph finish. At one point we passed beneath the womping
sound of giant 60 foot blade wind driven generators. Fort Davis was also
memorable for the locals we encountered from the professional artist, painter
of western history, to a 80 year old man known as "The Traffic Cop" because
he drove his Chevy 20,000 mile a year up and down main street at 20 mph,
thus keeping the tourists in tow.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The next day we rode along the famed Rio Grande tackling
a 15 percent mile long climb out of Laitias. At the top Beall was utterly
speechless from chasing down Pat. Rick was down and back up the other side
before we all recovered to do the descent. Our last grand excursion was
in Big Bend National Park. Unfortunately, time ran out before we could
extensively explore this majestic park. Arriving back in Fredericksburg
at 5 PM, it was still raining. Tom claimed it cleared up just after we
left.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Hell Week pros: good camaraderie with serious cyclists,
great cycling roads and routes, residents courteous to cyclists, Nick sells
a vast array of cycling stuff, refreshing and interesting culture and lots
of red meat.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Hell Week cons: weather downright ugly and not what promised,
room and board over priced, no mechanical support, no sweep vehicle if
you broke down, facilities too crowded because all of Texas is on spring
break and too early for blooming wild flowers.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I could write an entire saga on the last 24 hours of trying
to get home but this is a family paper, enough said with "I’ll never fly
Delta Air Lines again."</FONT>
<CENTER><B>My first (attempted) 200 km Brevet</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>Laura "I never want to see DNF beside my name again"

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Wow. I can’t believe its over and I missed it! We’ve had
April 19<SUP>th</SUP> circled on our calendar for months. We are going
to ride our first Brevet. Well, okay, so maybe we haven’t been putting
in the miles we should have been. But we can do it. This became our mantra
as April 19<SUP>th</SUP> crept closer.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Fast forward to April 19<SUP>th</SUP>: After arriving
at John Wagner’s place about 9:30 the night before we sat up talking until
close to 11:00. We woke this morning to a Seattle drizzle. In Wenatchee,
we would have called it rain. Its been three years since we moved from
Seattle to Wenatchee and we’ve acclimatized pretty well (we even go for
months without thinking the word "Goretex"). But this little drizzle wasn’t
going to stop us. No sirree.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As we drive up to the start I’m starting to feel a little
doubtful about this ride. Those clouds look awfully wet. I dredge through
my memories for anything I remember about the Puget Sound Convergence Zone
- wet is the only word that springs to mind.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At the start we pile on the layers. Hmmm…rain doesn’t
necessarily mean cold. This lesson learned, we stop at my first wrong turn
(less than a mile from the start) and take the opportunity to shed the
polypro turtlenecks. Already behind all of the riders (except for the guy
who started late and passed us way, way before the first control), we settled
down, decided to ride our own ride and enjoy the day. This said, it started
raining. Hard. Real Seattle rain, not this little misty stuff we’ve become
accustomed to. We can still do this. "Sean, we need some fenders for this
bike." "Laura, my feet are drenched-underneath my booties."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>About an hour later my body reminds me that I fractured
a tailbone cross country skiing. Well, 200 km of this is going to be fun.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Having decided that I wasn’t ready for 200 kilometers
of this much fun, I decided to go to plan B: the one where mom comes driving
around the course and I tell her to bring the car with a tandem rack to
the first control (having plan B was my ulterior motive in volunteering
her to help). I can make it that far. Maybe this long distance riding isn’t
for me. Lest you begin to think I’m whining I’ll just tell you now, I am
the Queen of Whining.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We rode to the first control, arriving about 15 minutes
before it officially closed. By the time we got our cards stamped, it was
closing time. Just made it. After a latte and a rest, my eternal optimism
began to surface. The next control is 67km and it doesn’t close until 2:48.
My logical brain wrestles with my enthusiasm. Logic wins. We wait.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As we drive back to the start, change into dry clothes
and watch the finishers come in, each one wetter than the one before, my
brain starts formulating a schedule to make up the 200 km. I’m not finished
with this long distance riding yet. I will finish a 200 km. And then I will
ride a 300 km, then a 400 km, then the 600 km. The Rocky Mountain 1200, well,
I’ll leave that for another year.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At the post-ride BBQ the finishers all offered us encouragement
to keep trying. I felt a little bit discouraged, watching them all come
in, wetter than a, well, really wet. But finishers. What do they have that
I’m missing. Lots more miles I decided. I heard someone talking about a
trip over Steven’s Pass. Someone actually hooked a bungy cord to his bike
to help him get to the top. (At least I think that’s what I heard-it made
me feel better anyway.) As I sat talking to John Wagner, before I even
had a chance to broach the subject of riding the 200 km route next month
while the rest of the group rode the 300 km route, he took the words right
out of my mouth "Laura, I’ve been thinking, the 300 km is an addition to
our Winslow 200 km. You could ride that next month."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We’ll be there. And we’ll finish. But please, order up
some sunshine for this thin Eastern Washington blood and bring on the miles…err…kilometers.</FONT>

own ride reports, you were going to have to read mine.)</FONT></I>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Volume 2 Issue 2 - March 1997</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Minutes of March 6, 1997 General Meeting</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR's second meeting of 1997 was held on March 6, 1997,
with 16 members attending. After some preliminary beers and socializing,
the meeting got underway at about 7:30 (with members waiting patiently
for their tortelini specials).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mark Roberts reported on insurance coverage. After some
discussion, the members agreed unanimously that we should join the League
of American Bicyclists (LAB), which will allow us to purchase liability
coverage at a very reasonable rate. Larry Ricker will make sure this coverage
is in place prior to the 200 km brevet on April 19.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mark Roberts volunteered to draft a liability waiver (based
on the LAB waiver model). All SIR brevet riders will be required to sign
this waiver.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Unanimity disappeared immediately, however, as the discussion
moved to the use of aerobars and other rules for brevet riders. It had
been decided in the meeting of Jan. 9 that aerobars would be prohibited
in keeping with current PBP requirements. This prohibition, which appeared
in a recent draft of expectations for SIR brevet riders, resulted in several
protests and communications from people who were not present at that meeting.
Thus, the issue was re-opened. Some continued to feel strongly that aerobars
were unsafe and should be prohibited. Others argued that the risk was mainly
for the individual using the aerobars (i.e., paceline groups could be self-regulating),
it would be a hardship for someone to remove aerobars just to ride in brevets,
and it would discourage potential new members. The issue finally came to
a head with a formal motion to prohibit aerobars. This was narrowly defeated
in a show of hands. Thus, aerobars will be allowed in 1997 SIR brevets.
It is possible, however, that this issue will come up again in a future
meeting.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Other (less controversial) refinements to the rider requirements
were made. Kendall Demaree will revise the expectations accordingly so
they can be released before the 200 km brevet.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Next was a discussion of the charge per rider for brevets,
and the possibility of non-SIR participants. After lengthy discussion,
the group agreed on the following policy:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>All SIR members must belong to IR.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Non-SIR riders will be allowed on brevets. They will be charged
a premium of $5. We hope this will encourage local riders to join SIR.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR riders will be charged $5 per 100 km, i.e., $10 for the
200 km, $15 for the 300, $20 for the 400, and $30 for the 600. These charges
are intended to cover route sheets, brevet cards, postage for mailing results,
liability insurance for the event, and route research expenses of the ride
organizer. Motel/room costs for the 600 are not included, nor are medallion
fees and other "extras".</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Proposed SIR bylaws (drafted by J. Wagner and L. Atkinson)
were distributed for member review and comment.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Rick Hippe reviewed his plans for the 200 km, including
his gracious offer to make his home available as the start/finish, and
to provide refreshments. Route details are to be published in the March
newsletter. Kendall Demaree announced that he is still looking for Fleche
teams. Anyone interested should contact him.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bill Dussler reported on the state of the club treasury.
He has established a SIR checking account. So far about 15 people have
sent in their applications and membership fees.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Larry Ricker announced that no further general meetings
were planned prior to the fall.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>John Wagner asked whether there was interest in a club
jersey. The response was positive, and John will check on costs, etc. He
also suggested a fall SIR social ride from Hood River to Timberline Lodge
on Mt. Hood, with an overnight at the lodge. There was general enthusiasm
for this, so John will make reservations for a small group. Details will
be announced later.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the hungrier attendees volunteered to finish off
all the leftover bread (to ease the load on the restaurant cleanup staff).
The meeting was then adjourned at about 9 p.m.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>1997 Membership</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1996 members who have not renewed their membership by
March 1997 will be dropped from the mailing list. As of March 21, 1997,
SIR has 20 paid members. Check your mailing label, if it doesn’t say1997
in the upper left corner, this is your last issue of SIR Rides Again.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>SIR Publication Deadlines</B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The SIR newsletter will be published approximately 10
times a year. Deadline for submission of information is the 15<SUP>th</SUP>
of the month prior to the newsletter you wish to have your information
in.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The planned printing &amp; mailing date is the third weekend
of each month…subject to delay by excellent riding conditions (which we
have a lot of herein Wenatchee) or a brevet that weekend.</FONT>
<CENTER><B><U>SIR General Expectations for Brevets</U></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>March 11, 1997</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This includes changes from the SIR general meeting on
March 06, 1997.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR = Seattle International Randonneurs</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>RBA = Regional Brevet Administrator (for SIR)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>ACP = Audaux Club Parisian</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>km = Kilometer, approximately 0.62 miles</FONT>
<CENTER><B><U>****** Expectations for brevet riders ******</U></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These expectations are intended to help form a basic understanding
among SIR brevet leaders and riders. Anything published in the SIR newsletter
or specified by the brevet leader takes precedence over these general expectations.
These expectations form the basis for SIR brevet rules and normal practice.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Brevet leaders may enforce these expectations as rules
and disqualify a rider for safety or rule infractions. In these expectations,
the words "must", and "required" are used to indicate a rule that can be
strictly enforced by the brevet leader. The words "may" and "recommended"
are used where the brevet leader can use his discretion, or modify the
rules by notification in the SIR newsletter brevet description.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must ride safely, obey all rules of the road, wear
helmets, and follow IR rules.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All SIR members will receive a SIR newsletter giving basic
information on the scheduled SIR brevets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must demonstrate that it is reasonable for them
to attempt a ride. Riders are eligible to move up one distance from a previously
completed IR sanctioned brevet in the same or previous season or attempt
a brevet of equal distance completed within the last four seasons. Assume
the basic "Super Randonneur" series of 200 km, 300 km, 400 km, 600 km, 1200 km
brevets, but where 1200 km and 1000 km are treated equally. The brevet leader
may make exceptions if convinced in advance that the rider is capable.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The SIR newsletter will give a brief route description
of each Brevet so riders may plan equipment and support. Ride fees will
be published in the SIR newsletter. The SIR newsletter will provide information
on joining IR and SIR.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These rider expectations and the IR rules will be published
in the SIR newsletter, SIR Web page (in near future) and sent to you when
you join or renew SIR membership. All brevet leaders will have a copy available
at the start of each ride for review purposes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There will be arrangements at the start of the ride to
accept an IR application form, a SIR application form, and collect any
ride or medallion fees. Brevet organizers will be available at least 30
minutes before the official start time. Bring exact change or a check,
or better yet, sign up in advance. Nominally, brevet entry fees are $5/100 km
with extra charges for medals, non-SIR members ($5), and overnight controls.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR will provide some liability insurance protection,
but riders are ultimately responsible for their own liability protection.
This is even more crucial for medical coverage, as the SIR coverage is
nominal and has a large deductible. Riders will be required to sign a waiver
absolving SIR and the volunteer ride organizers of any liability.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each rider will receive a route card, control locations,
and navigational instructions in the form of a route sheet. Maps are not
generally provided.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders who have notified the brevet leader in advance
are given preference if shortages occur of any resource. Normally, there
are a few extra copies of route sheets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Show up ready for the start of the brevet with exact change
or a personal check. Be ready to register for the ride from 15 to 30 minutes
before the official brevet start time. Unless otherwise stated in advance,
the brevet leader normally waits 1 hour after the official brevet start
time. All timing starts at the official brevet start time regardless of
a late rider's actual starting time.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to
oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note
that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and
riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be
mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each
bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these
may bother some other riders. The brevet leader may waive lighting requirements
in daylight brevets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Reflective vests and leg bands are recommended for riding
at night or during poor visibility and may be required by the brevet leader.
This is for your safety and others in the group.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Multiple redundant headlights, taillights, extra bulbs,
and extra batteries are recommended and may be required by the brevet leader.
Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage
front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel ) are recommended. Additional rear
splashguards are recommended for group riding.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Navigational instructions will include route sheet with
description and mileage (typically km also) of each major turn and control
point. Some rider judgment may be needed to compensate for minor accidental
route sheet errors. Each rider is responsible for their own route finding.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders are on their own and need to arrange for their
own transportation and assistance if they abandon the brevet. Any rider
abandoning the brevet must notify the brevet leader or SIR official. Randonneurs
are expected to be totally self-supported except as published in the ride
description or specifically informed by the Brevet leader.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Brevet leader will have an address and a phone number
listed in the SIR newsletter. Brevet leaders will address rider questions
within 10 days. Within the week preceding a Brevet, questions will be addressed
in two days. Calling the night before a Brevet is risky.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If the final control is not manned by a SIR official,
you must get a final control stamp at the control and mail your Brevet
card to the Regional Brevet Administrator.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Your Brevet card will be sent to IR headquarters and returned
to you with your medal when SIR receives the cards back. Sometimes this
takes a while.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Controls will generally have water and restroom, with
exceptions noted in the route description.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must carry their own tools, spare parts, extra
clothes, food and water. Brevet riders may assist one another on the road
with minor repairs, food, and water. (Note that this is in conflict with
ACP rules.) Riding in small self-organized groups is highly recommended
for safety.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Non-rider support is only allowed at the controls. Riders
may stop anywhere at stores or restaurants.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Drafting other official brevet riders is allowed. Extra
space and caution is recommended for longer rides.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Aerobars are allowed on Brevets if used safely. PBP riders
would be wise to avoid becoming dependent on them. Many experienced riders
choose not to use aerobars.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Any ruling disputes or unusual circumstances may be appealed
to the ride committee, but the ride committee will normally back the recommendation
and/or decision of the brevet leader.</FONT>
<CENTER><B><U>***** Brevet Leader Expectations*****</U></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For a scheduled ride, submit a ride description to the
ride committee for approval at least two months prior to the scheduled
date. Generally the dates for brevets are set in September the previous
year and submitted to Syracuse. If you have a passion for a particular
ride date you must plan this far ahead.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Submit a draft route description and draft route sheet
to the SIR ride committee so they can check it for mistakes, ambiguity,
and appropriateness as an SIR brevet. The ride committee must approve the
ride before it is published in the SIR newsletter.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The route description should include start time and date,
exact ride fees, support included in ride fees, any special requirements
such as reflective vests, and control abnormalities such as no restrooms
or no water. Orient this description to help riders plan equipment, resources,
and schedule.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Fill out the pre-Brevet paperwork.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Publish a general route description in SIR newsletter
a few months ahead of the ride. You must know the mailing schedule and
publication deadlines to plan this out, or else do it well in advance (2-3
months).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The route description should mention if any shared sleeping
arrangements are included in the brevet fee or whether overnight accommodations
should be arranged by riders themselves. The ride fee and amount of support
should be kept to a minimum in the spirit of the self-supported randonneur.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It is reasonable to ask for voluntary monetary contributions
from brevet riders if an unexpectedly low turnout or other unavoidable
and unforeseen minor expenses occur. Riders will normally be understanding
and supportive.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR does not normally reimburse for route scouting, cost
of maps, or other indirect costs. SIR would expect the brevet leader and
officials to be reimbursed for the cost of setting up an overnight control
location or minimal food support at a control where other food options
are not available. These costs should be known in advance and presented
to the ride committee for approval and figured into the cost of the brevet
entry.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Make sufficient route sheets and cards for the expected
number of riders and a few extras for unexpected riders. Make these up
well in advance.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you are unfamiliar with making control cards, the SIR
board can assist with determining control point times and route sheet details.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Have someone available as backup brevet leader in case
you can not make it to the ride because of an emergency.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Have someone help you so it is easier, more fun, and then
they will be ready to lead a Brevet next year!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Be at the start of the ride at least 30 minutes early.
Probably 45 minutes to an hour is better. Give riders a 10-minute and 2
minute warning of the start. Make every effort to get all riders off at
the exact starting time. Wait one hour after the start for any late starters.
Note that the Brevet leader can do the ride also and not wait around if
they explain this in the newsletter and the ride committee approves.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Keep records of who started the ride, who paid the brevet
entry fee, who paid SIR dues, who paid IR dues, and who paid for medallions.
There is an extra $5 fee for non-SIR a member. All riders must sign the
liability waiver form. Make sure there are enough copies of the liability
form.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All fees can go on one check and it should be made out
to SIR with a note listing the break down. SIR will consolidate all fee’s
that go to IR for that event, dues and medallions and send one check with
the recap sheet noting who paid what. Experience has shown this method
works best for the riders, SIR and IR.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>During the ride the brevet leaders have no responsibility
other than secret controls or any support specifically noted in the ride
description.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Collect all stamped cards at the end of the brevet. Be
sure to note the time if you collect cards at the end of brevet. Double
check card before letting rider leave. Make sure it is signed.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If the final control is not attended by a SIR official,
give instructions to riders to mail or deliver their card to the Brevet
leader. Otherwise, riders can expect to simply leave their control card
at the final control with a SIR official.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mail or deliver all paper work and fees collected (in
one batch) to the RBA as soon as possible. Paper work consists of the brevet
roster of participants, who paid, SIR dues, IR dues, brevet entry fee,
and medallion fee, and most importantly the brevet control cards signed
by the rider. The reason for a rider abandoning must be reported.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It is customary to provide the SIR newsletter editor with
a brief report on the brevet. This should include finishers and times if
appropriate. Include a short description of conditions and any unusual
events.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The RBA will receive the control cards from IR and see
that they get to the individuals. The RBA may make arrangements for the
Brevet leader to assist in this process.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The brevet leader may pre-ride the course and get brevet
credit by following the SIR and IR rules. The brevet leader may take along
one or two other riders for safety and to avoid schedule conflicts. Normally
these riders would be required to stay together. Only riders specifically
invited may pre-ride. The brevet leader has the right to turn down a request
to ride along. A pre-ride of a route is not required if it is well known.
We do not advertise these pre-rides normally because we want only people
we know and trust on them.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The brevet leader may ride the brevet if proper arrangements
for controls have been made. Note that this should be noted in the newsletter
description and also approved by the ride committee.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The brevet leader may use the ride committee and/or the
RBA to help clarify a rule or make a decision such as whether a rider is
capable of attempting a ride. In such situations, the brevet leader should
gather all relevant information and use the SIR officials in an advisory
mode.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The brevet leader or organizers may perform informal safety
inspections as a courtesy to riders. The brevet leader may disqualify a
rider for unsafe equipment. The rider will sign a form saying they are
responsible for their equipment, but this could help prevent some problems
.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The safety check might include such things as: Working
lights, check to see extra batteries, extra bulbs, sufficient clothes,
reflective gear, wheels properly secured into frame, handlebars not loose,
brake releases closed and sufficiently adjusted to stop the bike, sufficient
tire pressure,. tire pump, patch kit, sufficient water on a hot day, stuff
that could fall off and hit another rider, like loose bottles, lights,
pump, fenders, etc, helmet</FONT>

<CENTER><B>Hell of a Week - Part I</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>By John Wagner</CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For the past 7 years Nick Gerlich, UMCA director, has
held a early season, cycling training camp in Texas called "The Rides of
March" or better known as "HELLWEEK."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This year 108 riders from 28 states showed up. The Seattle
Seven who went are: John Enzweiler, Rick Hippe, Greg Jackson, Beall Korry,
Tom Lawrence, Pat Rodden, and John Wagner. This is my recollection of the
events.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 8 days of loops or out and back riding kicked off
8:30 AM Saturday. Each day covers just over 100 miles with around 4,000_
of elevation gain in "Texas Hill Country." Not wanting to waste a day,
Friday, for travel to Hell central, Fredericksburg, which at best takes
9 - 10 travel hours, I flew a red eye arriving San Antonio 8:30 AM Saturday.
The HELLWEEK announcement stating "Bring your sun block" with the predicted
hot and dry was too magnetic to resist. The sun shown brightly at 37,000ft
but at ground zero San Antonio the reality was tumultuous rain, raging
rain, rain and more rain. I rode the 80 miles to Fredericksburg with my
gear in a backpack and can never remember being wetter. The notion of "Hot
and Dry" was one of my mantras, another was "Kill Gerlich." A hot shower,
snooze and BBQ does wonders for the sprit. The next 3 days were pretty
much the same except for an occasional sucker hole sun break. Our Seattle
contingent, when not "assimilating local culture" with sojourns to Austin
and San Antonio, would find the round corners of a square course and finish
early with 60 miles for the day. They were becoming known as the Seattle
Slackers. One southern belle young lady, who had previously never rode
more than 2 back to back century days, reveled in needling the slackers.
But then she was riding with Tom Lawrence's "Quitting is not an option"
70 year old dad. I had the pleasure of riding with the likes of Muffy Ritz,
RAAM rider extraordinare, Connie Barns, "Michigan 24 hour" record holder
and ultra endurance rider John Hughes, all of whom were gracious, friendly
and a very social bunch.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The hill country roads are an excellent choice for cycling.
Most were rural, with no painted lines, many were single lanes connecting
farms and the few motor vehicles encountered were very courteous. The hills
were rollers and if you had a flat section for any distance a big climb,
may be a 1/4 mile long, awaited you and got your temples throbbing. We
were a couple of weeks early for the famed spring Texas wild flowers. Each
evening Nick posted a restaurant name for the sanctioned eating and watering
hole where you could swap stories with RAAM winner Gerry Tatrai, Muffy
or newly made road warrior friends but with all the wet and road grit ingrained
clothes, daily trips to the laundry had to be fit in and Pat, sick of cowboy
coffee, was ever in search of a "Cafe latte" fix.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Wednesday morning a major decision was made to leave "Texas
Rain Country" and drive west to Big Bend country. Beall, in his infinite
wisdom, had brought with him a wealth of touring information on this area.
As it turns out we were heading for 2 of the best rides in all of Texas.
Five of us: Beall, Greg, Pat, Rick and myself said good by to new and old
friends then piled into two rented cars for the trip west.</FONT>

membership is resolved.&nbsp; It was decided to require lights and reflective

<CENTER><B>SIR General Expectations for Brevets.</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>04 February, 1997</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>SIR = Seattle International Randonneurs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>IR = International Randonneurs</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>RBA = Regional Brevet Administrator (for SIR)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>ACP Audaux Club Parisian</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>km = Kilometer, approximately 0.62 miles</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Expectations for riders</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>These expectations are intended to help form a basic understanding
among SIR brevet leaders and riders.&nbsp; Anything published in the SIR
newsletter takes precedence over these general expectations.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must ride safely, obey all rules of the road, and
follow IR rules.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must be members of both IR and SIR.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All SIR members will receive an SIR newsletter which will
give basic information on the scheduled SIR brevets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders must demonstrate their ability to reasonably attempt
the ride.&nbsp; Riders may move up one distance from a previously completed
IR brevet in the same or previous season or attempt a brevet of the same
distance completed within the last four seasons.&nbsp; Assume the basic
"Super Randonneur" series of 200 km, 300 km, 400 km, 600 km, 1200 km brevets
, but where 1200 km and 1000 km are treated equally.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The SIR newsletter will give a brief route description
of each Brevet so that riders may plan equipment and support.&nbsp; Ride
fees will be published in the newsletter also.&nbsp; The SIR newsletter
should have information on joining IR and SIR.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These rider expectations and the IR rules will be available
at the start of each ride as part of the ride fee.&nbsp; One per rider
per season please.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There will be arrangements at the start of the ride to
accept an IR application form, an SIR application form, and collect any
ride or medallion fees.&nbsp; Brevet organizers will be available at least
30 minutes before the official start time.&nbsp; Bring exact change or
a check, or better yet, sign up in advance.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each rider will receive a route card, control locations,
and navigational instructions in the form of a route sheet.&nbsp; Maps
are not generally provided.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders who have notified the brevet leader in advance
are given preference if shortages occur of any resource.&nbsp; So let the
brevet leader know you are coming.&nbsp; Normally, there a few extra copies
of route sheets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Headlight, tail light, and reflective vests are required.&nbsp;
These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function.&nbsp;
Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times.&nbsp; Lights must
be operating at night on each bike in a group.&nbsp; Reflective clothing
must be worn by all riders at night.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Blinking tail lights are permitted, but note that these
may bother some other riders.&nbsp; Reflective leg bands are recommended.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Show up ready for the start of the brevet with exact change
or a personal check.&nbsp; Be ready to register for the ride from 15 to
30 minutes before the official brevet start time.&nbsp; Unless otherwise
stated in advance, the brevet leader normally waits 1 hour after the official
brevet start time.&nbsp; All timing starts at the official brevet start
time regardless of a late rider's actual starting time.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (1/4 coverage on
front wheel and 1/2 coverage on back wheel) are recommended.&nbsp; Additional
rear splash guards are recommended for group riding.&nbsp; Reflective tape
on fenders (and anything/everything else) is recommended.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Navigational instructions will include route sheet with
description and mileage (typically km also) of each major turn and control
point.&nbsp; Some rider judgment may be needed to compensate for any minor
accidental route sheet errors.&nbsp; Each rider is responsible for their
own route finding.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Riders are on their own and need to arrange for their
own transportation and assistance if they abandon the brevet.&nbsp; Any
rider abandoning the brevet should notify the brevet leader or SIR official.&nbsp;
Randonneurs are expected to be totally self-supported except as published
in the ride description or specifically informed by the brevet leader.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Brevet leader will have an address and a phone number
listed in the SIR newsletter.&nbsp; Brevet leaders will address rider questions
within 10 days.&nbsp; Within the week preceding a Brevet, questions will
be addressed in two days.&nbsp; Calling the night before a Brevet is risky.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If the final control is not manned by an SIR official,
you must get a final control stamp at the control and mail in your Brevet
card to the Brevet leader.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Your Brevet card will be turned into IR headquarters and
returned to you with your medal when SIR receives the cards back.&nbsp;
Sometimes this take a while.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Controls will generally have water and restroom.&nbsp;
Exceptions will be noted in the newsletter route description.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each riders should carry their own tools, spare parts,
food and water.&nbsp; Brevet riders may assist one another on the road
with minor repairs, food, and water.&nbsp; (Note that this is in conflict
with ACP rules.) Riding in Small self organized groups is highly recommended.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Drafting is allowed.&nbsp; Areobars are not allowed on
Brevets.&nbsp; (SIR does this to comply with IR rules.&nbsp; Also, since
PBP does not allow areobars, it is good training for PBP.&nbsp; This rule
may change in the future, but for now, no areobars.)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Any ruling disputes or unusual circumstances may be appealed
to the ride committee, but the ride committee will normally back the recommendation
of the brevet leader.</FONT>
<CENTER><B>EXPO Notes</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The SIR handouts at the Seattle Bike Expo were enthusiastically
received by many.&nbsp; .maybe we will see some new members (and some old
members who are dusting off their bikes for all the fun) this year.</FONT>
