<b>Reminder:</b> All riders are reminded that any failure to conduct the ride in accordance with <a href="../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Rider Expectations</a>, <a href="http://www.rusa.org/brvreg.html" target="_blank">RUSA rules</a>, applicable laws, or any special instructions or equipment requirements for this ride may result in a time penalty or disqualification.</p>

</b>
<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b> For this 200 km, there is a possibility of finishing after sunset, therefore:
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), taillights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
The Fall Season is upon again Folks, so as a polite reminder and courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
The Brevet Organizer encourages a SIR club Jersey, RUSA Jersey or Randonneurs Mondiaux (PBP Jersey). 
<p>
All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> The Brevet Organizer is strongly encouraging an Audax style ride to honor one of the traditions of our sport.
<p>
The Audax Club Parisien was founded in November of 1904. From 1905 on, the ACP organized the Brevets d'Audax, brought back from Italy by Henri Desgranges, head of l'Auto (a sports magazine). These consisted of doing 200 km between dawn and dusk at an average speed of 18 kph, as a group with a ride leader. Strict adherence to the pace was required.  
<p>
The Brevet Organizer cannot mandate that anyone adhere to a strict pace, but come on folks, ride with your friends, share a few PBP stories and have a good time (as Patty always points out, we look too serious out there).
<p>
This fall 200 km follows many familiar roads. We will start just north of Redmond at Tully's Coffee following SR-202 into Redmond. Then we head south to Issaquah along E. Lake Sammamish Pkwy.  We will then head over the hill towards Fall City (but not quite) and into Carnation. From Carnation we will head to Sultan via West Snoqualmie Valley Rd (Please note there maybe a detour here due to construction) and the Ben Howard Rd.  Leaving Sultan, we head to Granite Falls, seeing that steep little hill, and of course, Lake Roesiger.  From Granite Falls we head to Jordan where you will find a secret turn around, and then head back to Granite Falls via Burn Rd.  We will follow some low traffic roads back to Snohomish and Woodinville. Finish at the Red Hook Brewery.
<p>
<b>End of the ride:</b> Red Hook Brewery. Family, Friends and Foes welcome.
