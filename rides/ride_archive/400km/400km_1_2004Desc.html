Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride.  RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.<br>
<p>
<b>Special Instruction:</b><br>
Equipment Needed - Remember riding gear for inclement weather just in case, bike tools and spare tubes, and food/water for yourself.   Please see the "<a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">Expectations</a>" section of the SIR web site from whence the following has been excerpted:  For the 400 km, the following equipment is REQUIRED:                                          
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required.  Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors.  These may be checked and riders may be disqualified if they do not function.  Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times.  Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group.  Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother some other riders.                                            
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required.  This is for your safety and the safety of others in the group.                                          
<p>
Multiple redundant headlights, taillights, extra bulbs, and extra batteries are STRONGLY recommended, and may be required by the brevet leader.  Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.                                          
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are STRONGLY recommended.  Additional rear splashguards (or "courtesy flaps") are recommended for group riding. Note: Fenders are never required, only recommended.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> An old SIR favorite. We'll start in North Bend and take I-90 over Snoqualmie Pass to Cle Elum. From there we will head to Leavenworth across Old Blewett Rd. Then, from Leavenworth, we'll take US-2 back over Stevens Pass to Sultan. From Sultan, we'll follow back roads to Monroe, Snohomish, and Lake Stevens. From Lake Stevens, we go back to Snohomish and into the Snoqualmie Valley via Connelly Road and High Bridge Road. Carnation, Fall City, Snoqualmie Falls and FINISH!
<p>
Some riders requested that we use old Blewett Pass on this route instead of the new road, which we have done.  The ascent on the old road is a real treat, climbing up through pine forest.  Riders will need to use caution on the descent from the summit, however.  Slides have left sand and gravel in many places, along with some rocks.  This is all passable on narrow road tires, but riders will need to lower their speed on this part. To make up for the shorter distance over the old pass, at the start we will head west for a couple miles before getting on I-90 at exit 32.
<p>
The Paradise Lk Chevron (control #5) closes at midnight.  There will be an SIR volunteer there after that time with food and water before the final 60K to the finish.  There are 24 hr convenience stores in Snohomish as well (15K before Paradise Lk).
<p>
Drowsiness can be a problem for many riders at the end of a 400 km.  SIR will have a couple of rooms at the Edgewick in North Bend where people can shower and sleep for a bit after finishing the ride.
<p>
Listed below is the link to the endlesspursuit website that has all of the
nasty details.  The ride is so long that it doesn't really fit on the aerial
photograph map so use the topo map to view the route:<br>
