</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Club centuries are the highlight of many endurance riders' seasons:  the fun of a day on the bike with friends and the challenge of riding 100 miles.  And, at least for the day, an unrestricted diet!
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The Year Rounder is for century riders looking for a new challenge:  consistent performance throughout the year!  Can you ride a century (or longer) every month of the year?  You can maintain your fitness and have more fun cycling.  
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The Year-Rounder is a division of the UMCA Mileage Challenge.  All you need to do is sign up for the Mileage Challenge, and submit your centuries - we'll do the rest.  Centuries can be either Organized centuries or Personal rides that you design yourself (explained below). 
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<B>Mileage Challenge participants receive:</B>
<UL>
	<LI>an e-book Century Tips on training, nutrition, equipment and technique; </LI>
	<LI>an e-newsletter, sharing tips and stats; </LI>
	<LI>a bi-monthly Year Rounder column by Crista Borras and Chuck Wood, who ride centuries every weekend; </LI>
	<LI>a section at www.ultracycling.com devoted to the best century stories sent in by riders; </LI>
	<LI>a rider with at least 1,000 miles in the Mileage Challenge gets a discount on Accelerade and EnduroxR4.</LI>
</UL>

</P>

<A HREF="http://www.ultracycling.com/" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="UMCA_logo_lg.jpg" ALT="" WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="254" HSPACE="6" VSPACE="2" ALIGN="right"></A>If you reach the goal, we'll award you a Year-Rounder medal. Although the goal is a century a month, it might be too snowy or icy some months; so we'll allow two make-up rides.  For example, if you get snowed out in January, just do two centuries in February. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
For routing reasons some centuries are just under 100 miles.  In the Mileage Challenge a Century is a ride of 90 - 149 miles. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
You don't have to ride alone - UMCA members lead HUB rides in many parts of the country.  These are low-key rides - no t-shirts, no catered rest stops - just friends out for a day on the bike.  More information at:

Then put on your wool jersey, head out the door, and we'll do the rest.

The Year-Rounder honors Larry Schwartz, who won the UMCA Mileage Challenge in 2001, was second in 2002, and was leading in 2003 when he was struck and killed by a school bus. For a profile of Schwartz go to:  <A HREF="http://www.ultracycling.com/about/hof_schwartz.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.ultracycling.com/about/hof_schwartz.html</A>

<B>Rules Summary:</B><BR>
An "Organized" century is a ride with:  a name, designated start/finish location and starting time(s), route plan, organizer, and advance publication of the ride or ride series in club newsletters, etc.  
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
A "Personal" century is a personally designed ride. For credit, you must complete at least 90 miles in a 12-hour period including off the bike time (and maintain an 8.33 mph average after that).  Personal centuries provide century-length riding opportunities for riders in seasons or locales where Organized centuries are sparse.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Any Mileage Challenge ride counts in the Year Rounder-brevets, double centuries and ultra events. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
We like to keep the holidays free for time with the family, so the Mileage Challenge and Year Rounder will end on December 22, 2005.
