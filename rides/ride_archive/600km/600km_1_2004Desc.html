<b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b>                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are a must or you'll face the scorn and abuse of your fellow randonneurs. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>

<b>Route Description:</b> We'll start early to maximize daylight on the return of the North Cascades 600 km. From an Arlington start we will take back roads to Highway 2 via Granite Falls, Lake Roesiger, and Sultan. The route heads east over Stevens Pass (4061 feet) to Wenatchee. Up the west side of the Columbia on Route 97A through Chelan to Pateros. North on 153 to Twisp, where we'll pick up Highway 20 to Winthrop for an overnight stop and bag drop. (SIR will provide 5 cabins for showers and first-come-first serve sleeping space). In the morning, prepare for scenery and climbing as the route heads west over the North Cascades Highway (Highway 20). The fun includes Washington Pass (5477 ft), Rainy Pass (4855 ft), and the long descent to the west. At Rockport, we head south on Highway 530 to Darrington and the finish at Arlington. Total climbing for the route totals between 15,000-16,000 feet.
<p>
<B>Notes:</B> Beginning at mile 200 of Hwy 97A (Alt) north there is some road construction and repaving. For 2 miles the road shoulder is very rough and strewn with debris. At mile marker 203 new smooth pavement begins, but there is no painted shoulder, so stay to the right. Painted shoulder on the new repaving begin at mile 207. Construction ends at mile 213.
<p>
At control #5 Pateros the Chevron Super Stop after the bridge on the right is open from 5:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight.
<p>
In Twisp, Hank's Mini Mart is open from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and the Chevron from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
