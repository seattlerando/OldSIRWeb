<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b>
<p>
You have your choice of two routes, one which is flatter and extends from Packwood to Randle and back, or a hillier choice up to Paradise and skips the section to Randle. You must make your choice at the start.
<p>
Chinook Pass will have an SIR staffed control for food and water, otherwise stores are at Naches, Clifdell, Packwood, Randle, Packwood, top of White Pass and Naches.
<p>
There is an ATV park just past Clifdell - pay attention to drivers with ATVs.
<p>
The finish will likely not be manned - please bring your control card back to the Super 8 Motel in Ellensburg.
<p>
There is one 24-Hour restaurant in Ellensburg - the truck stop at Exit 109. There is a Super One Foods also open 24 Hours. Most other restaurants close around 10-11pm. I'll have food available for those that finish after restaurants close.
<p>
Please email with any questions about routes or services.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Most all riders will be finishing in the dark, so bring enough lighting for the front and rear to be seen from both directions. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders.
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group.
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> Selah to Cliffdell, over Chinook and Cayuse Passes to Packwood.  Back over White Pass to Selah.
<p>
<b>End of the ride:</b> Selah, WA
