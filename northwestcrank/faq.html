<br>
</p>

We will have support available at 1 or 2 spots on each ride.  Please check the route sheets for each day to see when and where support is available.  Additional services will be listed on the cue sheet as well.

At each support stop we will provide the following:
<ul>
<li>	Water/water coolers
<li>	Gatorade powder mix
<li>	Bagels and Bread
<li>	Peanut Butter
<li>	Jelly
<li>	Meat and Cheese at some stops
<li>	Costco Trail Mix

</ul>

You may put your own food and supplies into the support vehicles if you wish.  Please keep personal supplies to a minimum – about the size of a shoebox.  Please collect your supplies at the end of each day as different vehicles will be used each day.

</p>

Saturday night will feature a banquet at Garlinis restaurant, time will probably be around 6pm, but that’s still TBD. After we’re through enjoying the meal, we’ll gather for the White Elephant Bike Part Exchange. 

What’s a White Elephant exchange?  Everyone brings a wrapped gift – the gift is mostly a gag and pretty inexpensive.  Some examples of gifts include a bag of tubes that need patching or a solid rubber tire.  All the gifts are put on a common table.  Each person can either choose a gift or the gift from someone who’s already opened theirs. Why is it called a White Elephant?  Good question – I don’t know!

Monday will feature a group photo before the ride and distribution of 5x7 photos after the ride.

<font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="5"><b>What about food?</b></font>
<br>
</p>
There are plenty of restaurants nearby from fast food to nice restaurants.  A favorite from 2006 was Garlini’s Italian restaurant just down the street from Inn at the River. Shari’s is just down the street.  Starbucks is a block away for those who need their morning coffee fix.  There’s a grocery store a block away as well.  There are plenty of other restaurants within walking distance.

For dinner each evening we will have a recommended meeting time at the Inn at the River.  From there groups can choose where they want to go for dinner.

<br>
</p>
Bring your family or spouse along and make a family outing of the weekend.  Wenatchee itself has plenty of activities.

Cashmere has Aplets and Cotlets.  Leavenworth has some mini-golf and the charm of Bavarian architecture.  Go rafting or visit one of the many museums.  Lake Chelan is beautiful and close by.  There’s plenty of hiking or mountain biking as well.  Or take the day and head to the Yakima Valley for some wine tasting. Take advantage of the ample opportunities for exploring the area and having fun.  For information, go to <a href="http://www.wenatcheevalley.org">www.wenatcheevalley.org</a>.  For information on the Wenatchee Apple Valley Festival, which starts that weekend, go to <a href="http://www.appleblossom.org/">www.appleblossom.org</a>.

<font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="5"><b>Tell me about Brevets, Populaires, and Control Cards?</b></font>
<br>
</p>

Sunday’s and Monday’s rides are being organized under the history, traditions, and rules of randonneuring, specifically the Audax Club Parisian and Randonneurs USA (www.rusa.org) which is the US organization.  The Seattle International Randonneurs is a local chapter of RUSA.

In order to verify that riders have completed a brevet, controls and control cards are used.  Controls are points along a route where you must stop and get your control card signed.  Some controls are manned which means that your card will be signed by a volunteer.  Other controls at “OPEN” which means that you can go to any business in the control town and have someone sign your card.  Using the control cards will give you an idea of how brevets are run if you choose to do more SIR events; it’s not necessary for your to use the control cards during Northwest Crank.

Those who complete the 200km/125mi ride on Sunday using the control card are eligible to earn a medal.  To receive a medal you must be a member of <a href="http://seattlerando.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=41">SIR</a>) and you must be a member of Randonneurs USA (<a href="http://www.rusa.org">www.rusa.org<a/>); medals are $8.  As a member of SIR you are entitled to a newsletter, a variety of web resources, and discounts on all SIR rides.
