This was one mutha of a ride. It was my first ever SIR 600 km. Now I know why I generally 
avoid them. But, the scenery 
was spectacular.<br><br>

<center>Six of us did the ride:<br>
Andy Fuller 37:07<br>
Ron Himschoot 38:20<br>
Mark Thomas 38:20<br>
Duane Wright 38:50<br>
Ron Lee 39:08<br>
Lynne Vigesaa 39:08<br><br></center>

The course starts out meandering through the rural areas of Snohomish County, to go from 
Arlington to Sultan. A bit before 
Sultan, on a fast descent (with a sharp curve), there is a turn that is easy to miss. Andy 
and Mark were off the front, Andy missed the turn, Mark was busy calling
out to him and didn't see the gravel. Mark took a spill, wiping out his
new gloves, his new shorts and a crucial screw on his shoes. But, he
pushed on, having wrapped his shoe with some string, and had Wayne Methner
(the Winthrop support person) bring him another pair (Wayne met us at the
Leavenworth control).<br><br>

Anyway, I think we had a bit of a tail wind, on Highway 2. Andy announced
that he would try to reach Winthrop (233 miles) by daylight, and off he
went. He was merely doing this as a training ride for Mtn. Worlds
(California). Mark was hurting a bit but climbed the pass (4,061') o.k.,
as did the rest of us.<br><br>

Then we put on our windbreakers for the descent (actually fairly gentle)
east of Stevens Pass.<br><br>

The stretch through Tumwater Canyon was a spectacular as always.<br><br>

The sandwiches in Leavenworth were large and tasty. The weather was sunny
and, by our standards, slightly hot (maybe 80).<br><br>

Wayne Methner met us, at Leavenworth, with another pair of shoes for Mark.
We all felt better seeing him remove the injured shoe that he had wrapped
with string to keep on his foot.<br><br>

Just before Wenatchee we headed north, on Alt. 97, taking a lot of serious
headwinds. The five of us took one mile turns at the front. After
Ephrata Mark and Ron Himschoot separated from us a bit. The climb, to the
tunnel, after Ephrata, was quite serious. A thinking man would be tempted
to take regular 97, instead, and hope there was no secret control! 
<i>(We took a wrong turn and ended up in Ephrata! That's why we were late 
to the restaurant. I should have gotten a 
signature, in Ephrata. That would have been really impressive.)</i> <br><br>

After Chelan it was time for lights. The Pateros control was open 'til 2
something a.m., but the actual control (restaurant/gas/mini-mart) closed
at midnight. We got there about 22:10 (10 mintutes after the restaurant
closed, sigh). It was quite somber getting dinner from the mini-mart.
Ron H. and Mark had just made it in time to eat from the restaurant menu.
I dined on wheat thins, pudding cups, and hot cocoa. I was somewhat heart
broken to not have more to choose from.

Then we headed off toward Winthrop, a 42 miles trip, along the Methow
River, while we were all quite brain dead. It wasn't particularly
steep, and there was almost no traffic. We were pretty wobbly (being
brain dead) and didn't really draft. Its just that it was nice having
someone be in front ... and no need for all of us to pretend to be
thinking.<br><br>

We stopped at Twisp, to sit on the sidewalk and have a communal shiver.
Apparently I fell asleep with food in my hand! Then we headed out for the
last 9 miles. Somehow I was elected to take the front for the entire
stretch, which was actually o.k. because the slight nod out, on the
sidewalk, did improve my mental clarity (be it ever so slightly). At this
point I noticed light in the sky. I asked Lynne what city that could
possibly be. She informed me that that was called the sun rise.<br><br>

I remarked that we had had opposite goals of Andy Fuller. He had wanted
to make Winthrop in the daylight. We, OTOH, had hoped to make Winthrop
while it was still dark, in order to have enough time to get at least a
little sleep before having to push on.

It took us from 23:10 'til 03:30 to cover those 42 miles. The group had
two cabins at the Virginian in Winthrop. Wayne had a spread of food
waiting for us. We proceeded to eat and or take showers. I ate, then
layed down waiting for my turn to shower. Next thing I knew my alarm was
going off (from the Saturday morning setting -- I'd told myself to unset
the thing but had forgotten!). So, I had gone to sleep at perhaps 04:00
and was awaken at 04:33 (unnecessarilly). At 05:10 Wayne was stirring, so
I got up to shower. When I came out of the bathroom, everyone had
assembled in our cabin (site of the food). We had a bit of breakfast.<br><br>

Ron H and Mark were down the road before us. Andy came up, a bit later,
and chatted briefly before pulling away. He said his plan was to hammer
on the climb, then take it easy on the rest of the ride.<br><br>

From Early Winters the climb gets serious. The last 7 miles is a 7.5%
grade. We all made it to the top of Washington Pass (elev. 5,477').
Wayne was on top (in his car!) with more food and drink.<br><br>

Lynne was the last one to the top, lamenting that her horsepower seemed to
be somewhere else.<br><br>

Wayne mentioned he had fallen asleep, on top, and Andy had gotten by
without noticing him.<br><br>

It was truly amazing to see almost NO SNOW anywhere near the pass. I
recalled doing some very nice spring skiing there, in mid June, once.
The winter of 2000/2001 was truly a warm, dry winter.<br><br>

Mark and Ron H started the descent. I asked Ron L and Lynne if it was
o.k. for me to head down a ways as I was getting cold. They encouraged me
to go on. I was certain they would catch up to me, as they were riding
fine.<br><br>

I started the descent but there was lots of chip seat on most of the
pavement INCLUDING most of the shoulder. So I had to ride the brakes and
keep way over to the right side of the shoulder. There also seemed a lot
of turbulence. I squeezed the top tube, with my knees, but could hardly
control the bike. So I had to descend quite slowly.<br><br>

I continued the descent but couldn't stay awake. This seemed like a
dangerous combination, so I pulled over, found a sunny south facing bank,
and took a slight nap.<br><br>

Then I headed down again. I went a few more miles but was again having
trouble staying awake. I took another short snooze. By this time I
assumed that Ron L and Lynne had passed me.

I had the lane to myself, on the Colonial Creek descent, but didn't really
feel like stomping on it. Still, I got the bike up to 46 mph here. All
of my single bike speed records have been set here. I think the fastest
was 52 mph.<br><br>

The Diablo climb caught my attention. Then I kept a steady pace to
Marblemount (the last control before the finish). Here I dined on the
terriyaki essential sandwich I'd been carrying (now a bit tart!), V8
juice, and banana bread.<br><br>

Then I did the stretch down 20 to the Concrete turn off toward Darrington.
Somehow there is a state law that says it MUST rain any time one is near
Darrington. This law was complied with, in spite it being a very sunny
day. But the lone rain cloud only covered me for several miles, then it
was sunny again.<br><br>

At Darrington I caught Ron H. and Mark just before they were leaving.
They said they had NOT seen Ron L. and Lynne. Alas, this meant that they
were behind me. Ron gave me some cantaloupe, which hit the spot.<br><br>

I had a bit to more to eat, (macaroni, and some mango nectar) then set
out, not looking forward to this last stretch (34 miles) as now I was
heading due west, into the head winds.<br><br>

Alas, somehow my rythm started to develop. The saddle started feeling
tolerable again (I *should* had taken the Brooks, but instead had been
lazy and just left the 24 year old Ideale on the bike!).<br><br>

Gradually I realized that I was TTing this last stretch. I was a little
worried that I would run out of energy but kept cruising along.<br><br>

At one point I noticed a very large frog, hopping across the road. He
stopped to hang out on the painted median. I was tempted to go back and
shoo him across the road ... but I had a mission. I hope he made it.<br><br>

As everyone agreed, that last 3.7 miles, from Arlington to the motel, seem
to take forever. But, I was cruising, so it went o.k. About 1/2 mile
from the finish, Mark passed me, driving the other direction.<br><br>

Then I finished and a dapper looking Ron Himschoot shook my hand. He said
that Mark had to get home 'cause it was father's day and the kids were
waiting to do stuff with him. This gave the kids a chance to stay up late!<br><br>

Lynne had asked me to grab her room, so I did that. The clerk gave Ron
and me a funny look at said "You know this is just one queen size bed, don't you?"<br><br>

I explained to her the randonneur bonding process! Actually, I clarified
that the room was for others.<br><br>

Ron and I went to the room and were sitting, pondering getting
a pizza or something, for the last two riders ... when they arrived!<br><br>

We agreed that there was no time for showering because IF there was even
a restaurant still open (in Arlington), it most likely would close at
10:00 p.m., so there was a mass activity of throwing clothes everywhere
and putting on clean civilian clothes (over dirty bodies).<br><br>

Lynne excused herself, for a moment, went into the bathroom, and heaved
her guts out. Ron L said that she had been heaving all day long. Then
she came out and announced "I think that dinner would be an excellent
idea. Just let me brush my teeth first." Randonneurs are NOT without
propriety.<br><br>

We jumped in the two vehicles and zoomed to the Mexican restaurant in
Arlington. It was still open (closes at 10:00 p.m. on a Sunday night).
Ron H asked me to NOT let him have a beer! I had an O'Douls because I
figured I would need to make conversation with him to keep him awake.<br><br>

After dinner we said good bye to Ron L and Lynne. They would be
spending the night at the motel (our base of operations for the ride).<br><br>

Ron Himschoot managed to drive home, dropping me off at my place. How he
was able to stay awake, to drive, I do NOT know. I did a fair amount
of nodding off. Once home I fed the creatures ... and went straight to bed!<br><br>

It's about 5:00 AM Saturday June 23, 2001 and Ken Carter and I are sitting in a booth at the 
Arlington Denny's 24-hour restaurant. We're dressed in our riding clothes, sipping a pair of 
hot chocolates and I'm waiting for my Grand Slam to arrive. It could be an Edward Hopper 
painting entitled "Randonneurs" but we lack the glazed and gaunt look that only comes from 
hard miles on distant roads. We're damn near chipper. But this is prologue and we drove up 
here. It's not my usual style to get a ride to the start of a brevet, but Arlington is about 
100 kilometers from my home in Issaquah and I think I'll get in enough riding this weekend 
to not feel too guilty. In an hour we'll be riding the 2001 SIR 600 km. <br><br>

After breakfast, we sign in and see who else is here today. Mark Thomas is our brevet 
administrator and he's collecting our entry fees, making sure we sign the right forms and 
giving out the route sheets. Last weekend Mark, Andy Fuller, Ron Himschoot, Ron Lee, Lynne 
Vigesaa, and Duane Wright did the official pre-ride of this event and they all had ugly tales 
to tell involving evil climbs and wicked winds. Duane Wright had written a particular vivid 
account of the pre-ride and Bob Magyar is generous enough to share Duane's gory tale of woe 
with the rest of us while we tweak our bikes, consider our gear and wait for 6:00 AM to roll 
around. <br><br>

After his warm and somewhat hyponatremic 400-kilometer ride last month, Ken Krichman is here 
with a new found appreciation of salt. Ken is a nephrologist (kidney specialist) and should 
know better but on that ride he'd gotten way too low on electrolytes. When he was recounting 
his woes to me a few days later he said, "I was hyponatremic (low on salt) and that 
can make a person spacey, you know. When I got to the Cliffdell control, I ate about a whole 
bag of potato chips and I felt much better." At this point I'd expressed the view that if 
hyponatremia makes a person spacey then it seemed to me that Ken's been hyponatremic as long 
as I've known him and maybe he should install a salt lick on the front of his GoldRush. At the 
time Ken laughed off my suggestion, but I note that today he is packing a pretty good supply 
of saltine crackers. <br><br>

<img align=right border=0 src="600-12.jpg">
Jim Trout is quite possibly the nicest guy in the world. He also happens to be an incredibly 
fast endurance rider. On last month's 400 km he finished literally hours ahead of the rest of 
us and last weekend he knocked off 419.6 miles for a fifth place finish at the National 24 
Hour Challenge in Michigan. While many riders like to rest up between events, Jim's a little 
different. His idea of resting up is riding this 600 km. While the rest of us have goals like 
"just finish the damn ride in under 40 hours" Jim's plan is to do the ride entirely in 
daylight. He'll ride to Winthrop (getting there before dark), have a good, solid night's 
sleep, and ride the last 235 kilometers on Sunday. Jim's girlfriend Maryam is here to cheer 
him on and provide some support at the controls.<br><br> 

I'd put out the word that I was looking for extra SIR jerseys so I'd have some souvenirs to 
give to my British hosts at next month's London-Edinburgh-London ride and Jim's brought me an 
unused SIR jersey that he'd had stashed away. Seeing that I'm riding without a drop bag, he 
says "you can pick it up in Winthrop or at the end so you don't have to carry it the whole 
way" but I figure it doesn't weigh much and I'd rather do this transaction while my brain is 
still close to clear. I take the jersey and put it in my pack. To square the financial side 
of things, I pay Jim's entry fee for this ride. <br><br>

Most of the other riders have bags that Mark will shuttle up to Winthrop. I've always held 
with the "drop bags make you weak" philosophy and I'm frankly astounded at the size of some 
of the drop bags the others are using. I comment to Mark that I won't be taking that much 
stuff when I go to England next month and he says "sometime, I've got to take packing lessons 
from you." <br><br>

My friend Jon Muellner is also doing this ride without a drop bag. This is Jon's first year 
of randonneuring but to look at him you'd think he'd been doing this all his life. He's 
decked out for distance with a small handlebar bag, a Carradice saddlebag and a Humpback. 
He's kind of striking the middle balance between Jim Trout's unfendered Ti-bike minimalism 
and Bob Magyar's "there's a place for everything and that place is somewhere on my bike" 
belt plus suspenders school of preparedness.<br><br>
 
At 6:00 AM, fourteen of us roll out along the back roads through farm country, the small 
town of Granite Falls, past Lake Roesiger and on to Sultan on Highway 2. I know most of 
this area pretty well, but nearly half the turns on the entire ride are packed into 
these first 60 kilometers, so we take it fairly easy and pretty much stay together as 
a group until Sultan. <br><br>

<img align=left border=0 src="600-03.jpg">
Terry Zmhral, Anne-Marie McSweeney, Don Harkleroad, Dick Pado and Bob Brudvik all opt to 
take a quick break in 
Sultan, while Jon Muellner and I press on. Jim Trout, Tom Brett, and Ken Carter are somewhere 
up ahead while Ken 
Krichman, Peg Winczewski and Bob Magyar are somewhere behind Jon and myself. It's a great day 
for riding, with 
non-threatening clouds keeping things cool but not cold. Jon pulls ahead just past Sultan and 
Ed Husted passes me as well, 
just as we're going by a large carved wooden Sasquatch. Ed comments that you see some mighty 
strange things along this 
road. <br><br>

I take a bathroom and snack break at the roadside park in the town with the unlikely name of 
Startup and then ride through 
the town of Gold Bar (home of a reptile park). Around the town of Index I ride by yet another 
carved Sasquatch. Along side 
from these somewhat questionable tourist "attractions" we have the spectacular mountains that 
make up the Washington 
Cascades. I've tried various times to take pictures on these rides but have been forced to the 
conclusion that I lack the talent 
to create images that come anywhere near capturing the true scope of these mountains. <br><br>

<img align=right border=0 src="600-01.jpg">
I roll into the Skykomish control (kilometer 108) at 10:07 AM. Terry, Anne-Marie, Bob Brudvik, 
Dick and Don are loading up on food and drink and I do the same. Chocolate milk is a popular 
choice, but I opt for regular whole milk, a chocolate bar and some salted mixed nuts. It's a 
pretty quick break for all of us, and then we're off and climbing. <br><br>


Stevens Pass (kilometer 133.4) is at an elevation of 4061 feet. It's been a dry winter and 
there's virtually no snow up here now. It's 12:06 PM and the temperature is about 60 degrees. 
Mark Thomas has his car parked here as a secret control and I have a banana and pull on my 
rain jacket for what I know will be a fast and chilly descent. <br><br>

<img align=left border=0 src="600-02.jpg">
I'm a pretty strong climber, but I'm not known as a fast descender and pretty much everybody 
from the Skykomish group passes me on the descent. I pull into the Nason Creek rest area 
because I know from past experience that one of the local service clubs will be serving 
snacks there for weary travelers. I put a dollar into the donation jar and have three 
excellent homemade cookies and a glass of lemonade. Refreshed, I press on toward 
Leavenworth. <br><br>

Riding through the beautiful Tumwater canyon I again rue my lack of photographic skills. 
The river tumbles beside me in a frothing white noise that sets up a perfect cadence. I 
descend like water. At 2:00 PM, I hit a miniature traffic jam in the touristy faux-Bavarian 
town of Leavenworth. At 2:05 PM, I'm at the Chevron Station getting my control card signed. 
This is the 190 kilometer point in the ride. The same riders I saw at Skykomish are here as 
well, but they take off a bit ahead of me. I wash down a bag of Cheetos with a pair of 
Mochachinos and head out. It's warmer now, around 75 degrees. <br><br>

Just west of Wenatchee, I turn onto Alt-97 a fairly low-traffic road snaking northward 
along the western edge of the Columbia River. The next 250 kilometers of this ride will 
be over roads I've never seen before. Phrases from Duane's pre-ride report buzz around 
in my head like the lyrics to a really annoying pop song: "Serious Headwinds, Serious 
Climbs" by Duane and the Downbeats. Somehow I manage to focus on the dry beauty of the 
land and think how lucky we all are that today's weather is actually very good. We still 
have some cloud cover and the temperature is only around 80 degrees. We've got it much 
better today than those poor blighters did on the pre-ride. <br><br>

Before Entiat, I see Terry and Anne-Marie pulled over with a flat. They've got things well 
under control, but I still do the courtesy "you got what you need?" call as I pass. They 
assure me that they're fine and in fact they're back on the road and passing me a few minutes 
later. They're still at the Entiat control (kilometer 248) when I pull in at 4:24 PM. <br><br>

Ron Lee is here with a tire pump, topping off the tandem's tire and he's intent on filling us 
in on the climb ahead. I drink an orange juice and eat half a bag of brownie bites before 
following the tandem down the road. <br><br> 

Terry and Anne-Marie do a pretty good job of making that tandem move and they stay ahead of 
me up the climb and through the short tunnel. Then things flatten out a bit and they're 
gone. I ride through the town of Chelan and then up to our next control at Pateros 
(kilometer 308). <br><br> 

I pull into Pateros at 6:55 PM. It's a little cooler now, back down to around 74 degrees. 
Terry and Anne-Marie are here and so are Don, Dick and Bob. I get myself a pint of milk 
and some chicken strips. I eat quickly, take a few pictures of my fellow randonneurs 
(these photos probably won't turn out either!) and head off to SR-153. <br><br>

SR-153 winds mostly north and a little west along the Methow River valley. This is 
apple-farming country and along the river there are orchards, fruit warehouses and clusters 
of harvester cabins. But the bridges to the right of the road spanning the river
 are what really catch my eye. The first bridge is rickety, the kind of thing you'd expect 
to see in Thorton Wilder or B. Traven novel, or maybe in an Indiana Jones movie. It's a 
few frayed ropes, a bunch of weathered boards and more optimism than engineering. Still, 
a very brave or very stupid pedestrian might make it across on this structure, assuming 
he's lead a good life and the fates are feeling generous. <br><br>

A bit later I see a second bridge that makes the first one look like the Golden Gate. This 
bridge has more gaps than boards, more frays than ropes, more holes than a Swiss cheese 
factory. Indiana Jones wouldn't cross this thing even if all the Inca gold were on the 
other side and Lara Croft was calling him a frou-frou girly-man. <br><br>

The final bridge is only recognizable as a bridge because the previous two had got me 
thinking about bridges. I could build a better bridge by sneezing on a pile toothpicks 
and dental floss. It is a whisper of a hint of a suggestion of bridgeness, something 
akin to a dream or a nightmare, but weaker and far less tangible. Filaments that had 
once been rope dangle uselessly while twisted boards sway like rotting corpses executed 
years ago for long forgotten crimes. I try to figure out why these bridges are here, 
why time or fear of litigation hadn't torn them asunder years ago. I think about this 
for a long time, but I arrive at no satisfactory answer. <br><br>

Terry and Anne-Marie pass by me. A while later Don and Dick come chugging up and pull 
around. I settle in behind them, but Dick is kind of fading off Don's wheel, so I drop 
into the slot between them. Don is slowing down now and I feel guilty riding in his 
draft and I pull around to tow them for a bit. I'm a little guy and don't give much 
of a draft and the grade is going up now. When I look back, they're both dropping 
away. <br><br>

The sun is setting now and the sky is an amazing orange and blue mix. Again I try 
snapping some pictures but I'm sure the light is too dim. I see a deer come across 
the road and a few minutes later another one and then one more. I catch up with 
Terry and Anne-Marie as they pull over to put on their night riding stuff and adjust 
their lights. I snap on my headlight and taillight and ride on. <br><br>

<img align=right border=0 src="600-07.jpg">
I reach the cabins in Winthrop (kilometer 375) at 10:22 PM and I feel great. Tom Brett 
is there and so is Jon Muellner. Some of the others are there as well, but they've already 
settled in for the night. Mark and Ron have laid in a big supply of Mexican food and I 
have some beans and rice and tortillas and three big glasses of chocolate milk. While 
I'm eating, Don and Dick roll in. I ask Mark what time people are getting up to go and 
he says "around 4:30." "I don't think so," I reply and he says, "Well, when do you want 
to be woken?" "I'll wake my self up, but I'm not sticking around until 4:30!" I've got a 
couple of reasons for this. First, about three hours of sleep is plenty for me on a ride 
like this and second, I know Ken Carter is much faster than me and if I leave with him in 
the morning, he'll have to wait for me at the end. I don't like to keep people 
waiting. <br><br>

I wind up sleeping for a bit over three hours and around 2:20 AM I wander back to the 
control cabin to let Ron and Mark know that I'm heading out. I have a quick breakfast of 
chocolate milk and brownie bites and at 2:38 AM, I head west on Highway 20. <br><br> 

It's cold now, and it gets colder as I climb up toward Washington Pass. It gets light 
around 4:00 AM and the temperature is around 40 degrees. I see a couple of more deer 
and some incredible mountains. <br><br> 

<img align=right border=0 src="600-06.jpg">
Things get steeper as I ride toward the pass but this is a spectacular climb and it doesn't 
seem too bad. I'm looking ahead  at the peak called Liberty Bell and I think how I've become 
accustom to some of the optical illusions you see in the mountains. Often, for example, 
you'll see what looks like a solid wall of mountains only to find that there is some narrow 
pass through them that you've overlooked. I'm sure this will be the case today, and I must 
be looking at some kind of illusion because it looks like the road just zig-zags over 
Liberty Bell in some kind of mark-of-Zorro fashion and that certainly can't be right. That 
steep gash must be some kind of a fault in the rock. It can't possibly be the road. 
A big white van rumbles past me and I get to track it as it grumbles up and over the 
mark of Zorro. As the van goes up, my heart goes down. "They've got to be kidding!" <br><br>


It turned out to be an illusion. The road really does follow the mark of Zorro but what 
looks like a 30 degree slope from below is in fact just a continuation of the 7.5 percent 
grade I'd been chugging up for quite a while now. I try to snap some pictures to properly 
capture the grandeur of this place and I fail miserably. I do notice a rider coming up 
behind me. Knowing that Jim Trout was going to wait until dawn to start, the one thought 
that goes through my head is "please, don't let that be Jim!" Mark Thomas snaps my picture 
as I ride up to the Washington Pass control (kilometer 425, elevation 5477 ft). I pull into 
the control at 6:50 AM and two minutes later Jon Muellner pulls in. It turns out he'd only 
left about fifteen minutes after me this morning. <br><br> 

<center><img border=0 src="600-09.jpg"></center><br><br>
<img align=left border=0 src="600-10.jpg">
Ron and Maryam have set up a very cozy control here with kind of a three-sided tent facing 
the back of Ron's van. Earlier Jon and I had discussed the problem of cozy controls and how 
they make you want to linger and waste time. Jon's anxious to get going but I'm happy to enjoy 
the hot coffee, oatmeal, orange juice and wheat crisps. The propane space heater is pretty 
nice as well. Ron makes me a bagel for the road and I pull on my rain jacket and gloves for 
the cool descent Ron and Jon fill me in on what's ahead, a drop down followed by the climb 
up Rainy Pass and then another drop down to Ross Lake. Jon leaves and a couple of minutes 
later I too am headed down. <br><br>

It's a cold descent and the road is a bit rough. I shiver a bit on the descent so I can't 
get going too fast and I'm actually glad to see the road turn up for the climb up Rainy Pass. 
This turns out to be a very easy climb followed by some warmer and smoother descending. 
Before I get to the dam, I see Jon pulled over, peeling off his warm clothes and having a 
snack. I do likewise and head out. <br><br>

I'm completely running out of synonyms for gorgeous but Highway 20 will do that to you. Ross 
Lake is tucked into the mountains and is one of those amazing feats of engineering that 
looks spectacular, generates power and is a prime recreation area. I'm sure there are some 
hard-core monkey-wrenchers who want to blow up the dam, rip out the asphalt and restore the 
purity of this place but I'm perfectly happy to enjoy this impure intersection of engineering 
and nature. The lake is a deep jade green and the bridges today are solid, smooth examples of 
why I'm glad there are at least a few people who stayed awake in physics class. <br><br>

I stop at Newhalem thinking that I'll grab a snack and use the bathroom, but I'm thwarted 
on both counts. It's 9:40 AM and the store doesn't open until 10:00 AM and the public 
restrooms are closed for cleaning. I pull back onto the road just as Jon rolls 
by and I catch up with him. He's focused and mad. He tells me a truck towing a boat 
trailer nearly crowded him into a guardrail on the last metal-decked bridge and he felt 
the boat brush up against his left arm. It takes a few miles for his heart rate to drop 
down to normal. <br><br>

We pull into the market at Marblemount (kilometer 515) at 10:20 AM. We take a longer than 
usual break here, loading up on food and chatting. We figure the others would've caught 
us by now. Jon doesn't know what the route is like between Rockport and Arlington, but I 
assure him that compared to what we've done, the rest of the ride should be easy. I eat a 
Slim Jim, a packet of striped cookies, and a granola bar. I drink a pint of milk and get 
a white mocha from the latte stand. I'm not planning on stopping again between here and 
Arlington. <br><br>

While we're finishing up our feast, Ed Husted pulls up. He tells us that he's pretty sure 
that Jim, Tom and Ken Carter are behind him, but as is common in long rides, none of us are 
quite sure of that. Sometimes riders pass you when you're stopped and 
you never see them. Still, we're pretty sure that we're in the lead right now. <br><br>

Ed goes into the store to get his card signed and get some food. Jon's ready to go and 
takes off and I follow him about a minute later.<br><br>  

Jon and I never really draft off each other. We're both fairly slim so neither of us offer 
much of a draft. After Rockport we turn down toward Darrington. The traffic is lighter now 
and we ride side-by-side for a bit. As is usual for Darrington, there's some rain but it's 
pretty light. I tell Jon that it pretty much always rains in Darrington and we'll probably 
ride out of it. <br><br>

<img align=right border=0 src="600-13.jpg">
We turn west at Darrington and now we're headed into a headwind. This is where I've got the 
advantage over Jon. I'm a little smaller, my baggage is a bit more aerodynamic and my Bike 
Friday is less effected by headwinds than a big-wheeled bike.  Also, I think I might have 
a bit more left in my legs at this stage of the ride since I haven't been hauling around 
quite as much  stuff as Jon. Whatever the reasons, as soon as we turn into the wind, I 
get real small and peel off the front. Jon can't keep up. <br><br>

It's the home stretch and I'm feeling fine. As we always say "brevets are not races" but 
it still feels good to look at my watch and see that I'll probably finish this thing in 
less than thirty-three hours. And it feels great to look behind and see nobody else 
back there. <br><br>

Well, I imagine that it feels great. Because in actuality, there's a rider back there 
and he's closing fast. <br><br> 

Damn fast. <br><br> 

And he's here.<br><br> 

Five miles from the end and Jim Trout, the nicest guy in the world, pulls up along side me. 
"Hiya, Kent. What a great day. It looks like we're going to break thirty-three hours!" 
Despite the fact that there certainly is a part of me that would've liked to "win" this 
brevet, it's impossible to not like Jim. <br><br>

"Yep," I reply, "don't let me hold you back." But Jim won't hear of it. Even though he could 
drop the hammer at any time, we're not racing. We're just enjoying another fabulous day of 
riding. I am, of course, pedaling for all I'm worth because now I want to
make damn sure I don't make Jim miss the 33-hour point. <br><br>

We pull into the parking lot of the Arlington Motor Inn at 2:58 PM (official Mark Thomas time). 
We've ridden 609.5 kilometer according to Mark's official calculations, while my computer 
calls the distance 616 kilometers. In any case, a great ride with great people. <br><br>

At the finish line I have a Coke, some potato chips and an ice cream bar. Jon Muellner pulls 
in at 3:12 PM, followed a few minutes later by Ed Husted. Ken Carter comes in a few minutes 
after Ed. After Ken grabs a snack and cleans up a bit, we load the bikes on his car and 
head for home. <br><br>

Postscript: Mark Thomas had to fly to Europe the next day, so I don't have the final results 
for everyone. I do know that everyone finished except for Bob Magyar, who ran out of time 
and wound up DNFing at Marblemount. <br><br>

Postscript 2: Mark emailed me the final results and reitterated the opinion that the preride 
was "ugly". <br><br>

		<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT width="100%">I was a little unsure of how I'd 
cope with this distance after getting battered in the 400 km, but I had vowed to complete 
the series and so I loaded up and arrived at the Arlington Motor Inn Friday night. I got 
all my stuff prepared and stocked up on food. I had just picked up a can of Endurox R4 to 
try out (maybe not smart, but oh well). Not knowing how the weather would be I also packed 
an extra vest and booties and warm tights. I opted to have no bag drop because my goal 
is to always be self-supported on these events.
<p>
Got a pretty good night sleep, hearing the traffic on I-5 was like waves crashing on a 
beach. I woke up at 4:15 and started eating and getting ready. I put Endurox in one 
bottle and water in the other and in the Humpback. Light tights and a windvest (no 
purple leg warmers this time!) The people at the motel were nice enough to let me 
leave my truck there over the weekend and I rolled the bike over to the start by 5:30AM.
<p>
I think there was about 14 people all ready to go and I chatted with Mark T., Ken K., 
Bob M. and Kent P. Bob brought the report from the pre-ride with all the gory details 
of headwinds and puking. It was amusing reading, confirming the lack of sanity in these 
endeavors...The official start time was 6:00AM and everyone was raring to go. We all 
headed out and rode in a pack for the first 40 miles or so till we hit US-2. I got to 
chat with Jim Trout and another rookie, Bob Brudvik (thanks Kent), who's been doing 
doubles in Davis and the like and it's all really friendly and calm, a nice way to 
start the day.
<p>
Once we hit US-2 the pace picked up, Terry and Ann Marie and a few others stop at the 
store and Kent and I take off. In a short while I don't see Kent anymore and feeling 
the welcome tailwind decide to just put the hammer down and cruise. The Skykomish 
control is a quick in and out (9:57AM). I make it to Steven's Pass in what seems like 
a very short time and Mark is there at our first secret control. Just ahead of me are 
Ed Husted, Tom Brett, Ken Carter and probably Jim T. I'm feeling really good and 
decide to just keep pounding away. Leavenworth (1:15PM) is next and I stop in where 
Ed and Tom are. I grab some goodies and water and head out. Good thing too -there is 
a line of cars all backed up behind a marching band going down the middle of the 
highway! I skirt past all the cars and just as the band turns right I ride behind 
the tuba player and slip through. What excellent timing and all those past years 
of commuting have paid off...
<p>
More tailwinds and the turn for US-97 looms ahead. CSN was the music in my head. The 
temps are still very tolerable on this side of the Cascades and I continue wearing 
long tights and a wind vest. Arm warmers are down though. Entiat (3:40PM) is the next 
control and Ed, Tom and I are still hanging within a mile or two of each other since 
Leavenworth. Continuing tailwinds bring us to Pateros (6:27PM)  and we all stop for 
food. Ed and I get some pizza slices and take a booth seat to relax while Tom finds 
batteries. He looks anxious to get moving and soon he's off. Ed goes next and after 
I fill my Humpback I'm on my way too. Now the headwinds start and the tiredness has 
to set in. A cookie falls out of my bag and I have to flag a car to go around it so 
he doesn't smash it. The food is saved! The remaining miles to Winthrop are a bit 
slower now and the daylight is just starting to wain as I get to Twisp and Hwy 20. 
<p>
I stop at the Twisp Station for some chips and the lady at the counter tells me one 
of the riders just took a 20 minute break and was looking kind of rough. I later find 
out it was Ed. (That boy needs to eat more food!) Finally I flip on the lights for the 
final few miles and roll into the Virginian at 10:07PM. I'm still feeling pretty good 
and WOW -more food! (I love to eat). The support that Mark put together was phenomenal, 
burritos and oddles of other goodies were waiting and a bed and shower too!  I ate and 
headed to Cabin #2 for a shower and sleep. Terry and Ann Marie had the bedroom and Tom B. 
and I had the pull-outs. I was asleep by 11:00PM.
<p>
<img align=right border=0 src="600-05.jpg">
I had set my alarm for 4:15AM, as most everyone was planning a 5:00AM start. For some 
reason I popped awake at 2:15AM, decided I was too wired to sleep any more and started 
getting ready to head out. Went outside to pack the bike and saw Kent's Bike Friday was 
still there. I went back into the cabin and grabbed the final things before heading into 
Cabin#1 for some snacks to bring. I came out and Kent's bike was gone! Damn. I had a feeling 
he would be the first one out...I grabbed a muffin (which then fell into the dirt; I ate it 
anyway) and a banana and headed out. Kent was about 15-20 minutes ahead and we had a few 
hours to go before reaching the Washington Pass summit. It was dark and clear, the stars 
were out and a slight wind made a nice early morning ride.


I had ridden this route west to east last year on 
tour, so I knew what it was like, but I really enjoyed watching the sun come up and hit 
the top of the peaks around 5:00AM. I stopped near Lone Fir Trail and listened to the birds 
for awhile. Very peaceful and the pines smelled so good. I saw many dear and rabbits along 
the road and slowly got to the final switchback. The pass looks a bit more intimidating then 
it really is as the slow climb from Mazama to Lone Fir is more tiring I think. I could see 
Kent above me with Liberty Bell looming above us both and tried to catch him before the top 
(knowing full well he would not allow that!) I got to the pass a few minutes behind him 
around 6:52AM. Ron Lee was there; our second secret control, and as usual he was the perfect 
host, making me some strange concoction of hot coca and oatmeal mixed together which actually 
tasted pretty good! I headed out a few minutes before Kent and for the first time was the 
first rider in the brevet! Whahoo! Well, it felt pretty special at the time...
<img align=left border=0 src="600-08.jpg">

<p>
Climbing Rainy Pass was quick and then the long descent to Ross Lake. Music in my head had 
switched to Aerosmith. I had on my J&amp;G jacket and heavier tights, but soon the temps 
warmed up and Kent pulled up as I was peeling off some layers before the dam. We ate a 
snack and he headed out. I fiddled with some stuff and finally got off a few minuted later. 
There are two climbs between Ross Lake and Diablo before getting to Newhalem. Before Newhalem 
is a metal grate bridge that crosses where the Gorge Creek waterfall is. I was just ahead 
of a pickup truck and boat trailer and right at the bridge he squeezed me nearly into the 
steel guardrail and I could feel the boat brush by my left arm. I was so pissed off! There 
was no one coming from the other direction and he could have easily been going slower and 
not crowding me. I picked up the pace in the hopes of catching him in town taking a senior 
moment. I was ready to truly bite his head off and cause a serious uproar. Do not mess with 
a tired rider who has just ridden 300+ miles on little sleep! Needless to say, I never saw 
him again. Kent found me "focused" through Newhalem, head down and cruising. It took awhile 
before I calmed down.


<p>
Last control was Marblemount and Kent and I rode in at 10:37AM. We took a long break, ate 
and chatted. It was funny to think that we were the only self-supported riders of the group 
and here we were in the lead. Very amusing and we kept wondering where Jim, Ed, Ken and Tom 
were. Any moment we thought we'd see them barrel past. Soon Ed did show up as I was heading 
out, so we knew our places were tenuous. (I know it's not a race, but it is fun after so 
many hours of riding to see what happens to everyone!)
<p>
Kent soon caught up to me and we rode together through the spitting rain after Rockport. 
I didn't really have any idea what the terrain was like, but Kent assured me that it was 
basically an easy run in, which it was, except for the winds. About 30k from the finish the 
wind was more than I could take and Kent pulled out ahead. I settled into a comfortable pace 
and clicked off the kilometers. Jim finally passed me and all I could think was "I wonder 
how close to the end he'll catch Kent?" Go Kent! Jim was cruising, headphones and aero bars 
and a fast cadence. Even considering keeping up with him was an illusion for me. I kept 
looking behind me, but no Ed. That was strange.
<p>
I made the last turn onto SR-530 and arrived at Arlington Motor Inn at 3:12PM. Amazingly, 
I was the third rider in after Jim and Kent, who finished exactly together. (I love this 
sport!) Next came Ed, who said that he had just plain run out of steam and then Ken Carter. 
I drank a Coke and chatted with everyone and then packed up and headed for home by 4:00PM. 
I still had three hours and a ferry ride and I was a tired but happy boy.


<p>
Thanks to Mark Thomas for a great route and support, Ron Lee and to all the randonneurs I 
got to spend time with --it was a great finish to my goal of completing the series! Now...
about that 1000 km...

390 miles (620k) in 33:12 hours avg. speed 11.7 mph/18.8 kph overall (26 hours on bike;

If anybody has ridden a DBC brevet before, you know that the support along the course is tremendous. Since I had heard 
this from other riders, I was pleased to see that they lived up to their reputation for the Gold Rush Randonnee (GRR). 
The route was an out and back course starting in Davis, Calif (# 1) and going to Goose Lake near the Oregon border. It 
was relatively flat for the first 100 miles, middle 80 miles and last 100 miles. So all the 26,000 cum altitude gain was within 
approximately a 470 mile section of the route. The weather was unusually moderate which was good for all us out of state 
riders. The 75 to 80 degree weather in Oroville was hot, but not unpleasant as long as you were moving.<br><br>

The 6:00pm start was eventful due to an unexpected accident while everybody stood in the parking lot listening to 
instructions. I was bumped into by another rider who lost his balance, causing me to sit on my rear wheel and bending it. 
After a quick exchange of wheels by the SAG driver extraordinaire, Lee Mitchell, the ride started. The riders paraded 
out zig zagging through the flat countryside and spreading out as the faster riders picked up their speed. Somewhere 
before a water stop between Davis and Oroville I metup with Tom Parsons from the San Diego area. We had been in 
a larger pace line which dropped down to around 5 or 6 riders keeping a comparable pace. At the first stop in Oroville 
(# 2) there was a mechanic to work on the bent wheel, and someone to build a deli sandwich for you, or offer a pleasant 
comment. After the control, the climbing started up Jarbo Gap and then ascending into the Sierras by way of a long easy 
climb up the Feather River Canyon, passing Tob in (# 3), and coming to an open valley where the small town of Greenville 
(# 4) gave riders a rest from the long climb. <br><br>

After meandering around an open meadow the road turned into small rolling hills as we went up another canyon passing the 
small town of Genesee. I had driven down through this area earlier and had lunch at the Genesee store and learned that it 
was built in the early 1900's. The road now became a much steeper climb as we got closer to Antelope lake where a 
water stop had been established. As we continued climbing, we got a view of the mountain range, and could see a huge 
dark sky to the East with lightning every few minutes. This thunderstorm we learned, would continue reappearing over the 
next 3 days as our ride took us North. After refueling at Antelope lake, we reached the Top of GRR (6340 ft) on a curve 
along the road where a small sign on a stake was placed. This milestone would become monumental as all the riders passed 
it on the return leg home to Davis. The route continued a few more miles along the top ridge of the mountain range, and then 
reached the top of Janesville grade. This fast descent gave us a chance to see what we would be climbing on the trip back. 
After riding in the cooler Sierra Nevada Mountain range, we reached the bottom of the valley to Susanville (# 5) where the 
85 degree heat came out to warm us up. <br><br>

Antelope Pass was a big six mile climb out of Susanville that could be seen from the town below. This led into rolling hills 
that gave riders a long roller coaster ride that descended to a high valley with a climb back up to a summit, then a second 
descent into Eagle Lake. Here, another water stop was setup to support the riders between the 40 mile stretch of road 
from Susanville to Adin. A rented U-Haul was used to hold 3 or 4 large water containers and some assorted snacks. 
This became a much needed shelter as the thunderstorm we had seen earlier finally caught up to us. It rained quite hard 
for 30 minutes, causing several riders to stop and wait it out in the van. This allowed Tom and I to regroup and continue 
riding together after being separated from the descent from Antelope Pass. After more rolling hills and a fun gradual 
descent thru a forested valley, we reached the small town of Adin (# 6). Here the whole town participated in helping the 
riders at the Community center where the control was setup. It was a large building with a cafeteria and sleeping quarters 
inside, and a semi-trailer parked outside that had showers. Several people stopped for their first sleep break here after 
riding approx 500k and staying up through the night and first full day. I opted for 3 hours sleep while Tom decided he wanted 
6 to 8 hours. It was here that I was able to find a replacement for my seat post by borrowing Lee Mitchell's own bicycle seat 
post. Lee is an exceptional SAG driver. He had just finished SAGing for RAAM and has supported many other long rides in 
the California area. It was also a stop for Keith Fraser and Michael Lau (both Canadian) who were leading the ride, and 
now taking a food break. They had already been to Davis Creek (turn around point) and were on the return leg back to 
Davis. At this point they had done 700k without sleep and still looked strong.<br><br>

I got up around 10:30pm to leave by 11:00 for the 12 mile climb up Adin Pass. The climb gradually became harder the 
closer I got to the top. Nothing greater than 7 percent, but enough to create an enjoyably long descent to the high valley 
region where pastures and sage brush grew around Alturas. From here the short 20 mile ride to Davis Creek, the turn 
around point, was mostly flat and open. A Best Western was used at Alturas (# 7) where the DBC setup a canopy right 
outside the motel rooms in the parking lot. Support was tremendous as usual, plenty of hot chocolate, deli sandwiches and 
drinks. I napped for a half hour and then rode to Davis Creek (# 8)and back with the inconvenience of a pack of dogs. It 
must have been fun for the dogs chasing riders going out and coming back, but it was stressful for the riders. I remember 
passing riders at 7:00 in the morning and having them yell out to watch for the pack of dogs ahead.<br><br>



The route back was busier now that it was daylight and those riders who had opted to sleep more in Alturas (# 9) or 
Adin for their first sleep were coming out and enjoying the second full day of riding in sunny weather. On the return trip I 
was pummeled briefly by a hail storm and then rain by a thunderstorm between Adin (# 10) and Susanville. It hailed so hard 
most riders stopped and stood under trees along side the road. Continuing on, I reached Susanville (# 11) by mid afternoon 
and showered for the first time. A motel was used for the control, and riders could come up and drop their bikes in the 
grassy front yard of the rooms reserved for DBC and lay down to savor the cool grass. After eating, sleeping and then eating 
again, I proceeded to ride out at 10:00pm to tackle the toughest part of the route, Janesville grade. The hill is outside of 
Susanville by about 20 miles and is immediate and unrelenting for 5 miles. I met two riders at the bottom of the grade and 
said hi without stopping. One of them seemed to be trying to motivate the other by urging him on, telling him to just take an 
easy pace. I don't know any other way to climb a hill as steep as this grade, just slow and easy is the only way. After the first 
3 miles at 6 percent, the climb abruptly went to what I perceived to be 10 percent, then 14 percent. This was suddenly the 
toughest climb I had done on any brevet after riding 500 miles/ 800k. It was a surprise because it was around midnight and 
pitch black except for the small battery light I had on (generators don't work at 4 mph). The sky was perfectly clear with 
stars shining out against the light blue background and framed in by the blackness of the trees lining the road. The climb 
became a struggle, and then, it became a challenge to ones pride. While resting at Susanville I had discussed this climb with 
a rider who had left ahead of me. He had mentioned that he has never had to walk up a climb since doing brevets over the 
last 20 years. I don't recall having walked either, but after seeing this climb in the daytime on the descent, it became clear 
that the articles written about the route had over rated it. It didn't appear to be 15% or greater, as stated in the article I read. 
So I continued climbing and then started zig zagging to keep my pace up. The 39 x 25 was working fine for me as long as I 
used the whole road. After about 50 - 75 yards of doing this, the road finally became an easier grade of 2 - 3% and then 
became undulating hills until reaching the Top of GRR. The sign along the road on a quiet wooded section of the Sierra 
Nevada mountain range was now indicating the route would be mostly down hill for the remaining 200 miles. <br><br>

It was cool out now that it was about 2:00am, and we were riding at the top of the mountains. After a tremendous amount 
of sweating, it became cold with the descent into Antelope Lake. A handful of riders arrived together at the water control 
at Antelope and we all shivered until the support people started up their heater in the Jeep nearby and let us warm up. The 
warmup was short lived, since we had to get out and descend a 10 mile section down to the high meadows around Taylorsville 
and then travel another 15 miles before riding the relatively flat road around the perimeter of the meadow to Greenville (# 12). 
After an hour and a half of sleep at the Hideaway Resort Motel in Greenville, I started riding around 6:30am on the third day 
for the final push into Davis by dinner time. It was another sunny clear blue sky out and the road was still quiet with only a 
few riders out on the road who I had descended with earlier this morning. The Feather River Canyon was easy going and I 
was in the best mood of the whole ride. The route was now going down the long grade to the small control of Tobin Resort 
(# 13), where we would fill up with water for the last climb of the ride and the descent into the hot summer heat around 
Oroville. After the Tobin Resort control, the climb up Jarbo Gap was hot and slow, with cars, logging trucks and RV's 
passing bike riders that were on the road. <br><br>

Upon reaching Oroville (# 14) I metup with two riders, Paul Guttenberg from Davis, and Glenn Smith from Saskatchewan. 
We decided to ride in together for the last 100 miles and enjoy the scenery. We putzed along telling stories and sharing 
experiences from work, rides and life. About halfway to Davis a control was setup in a farmers front yard with food, 
beverage, cots, chairs and plenty of grass and shade. We were greeted with applause and given plenty of attention by the 
DBC volunteers. Glenn took the offerings seriously and had ice bags put on each knee and one ankle to help ease the pain 
from the ride. The volunteers took pictures and then after some joking about us taking advantage of their hospitality, we 
decided to ride off before they had to kick us out of the control. The remainder of the ride was mellow and uneventful except 
the head winds we had about 15 miles outside of Davis. We finished at 7:56pm at the historical Boy Scout Cabin in 
downtown Davis (# 15). <br><br>

The route was challenging and beautiful for anyone who hasn't been in this part of the country. All the controls were well 
staff and the amount of SAG support between controls was unbelievable. I have never been on a ride where a broken 
pedal or handle bars could be fixed/replaced by SAG drivers between controls during a 1200 km ride. The approximately 
150 Davis Bike Club volunteers, B & L bike shop and all the other sponsors were superb in putting on a great ride.<br><br>

<b>A special thanks to the mechanics at Tobin, Oroville and of course, Lee Mitchell, who kept me from DNF'g not once but 
twice. Cheers to DBC volunteers, I will see you in 2005!</b><br><br>

<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT width="`100%">



<p>I've never ridden through a castle before. Actually I'm not riding
through the castle proper, but rather through the grounds of Castle 
Howard, a sprawling 18th century estate in Yorkshire, England. As
I roll up to the massive outer wall, I have to stop and take pictures
and gawk like a tourist. In England, history isn't just locked away in
museums or musty books, it's right here, right now, beneath my wheels
and all around me.
</p>

<p>I'm riding London-Edinburgh-London, a 1400 kilometer brevet held
once every four years under the auspices of Audax UK and the Randonneurs 
Mondiaux organizations. It's early in morning of the second day and
I'm getting my first taste of what Mark Brooking had cheerily called 
the "lumpy bits" of the ride. I'm beginning to understand the British
talent for understatement. Back home, we'd call these things hills.</p>

<p>Of course, back home we wouldn't have called yesterday's 296 
kilometers "flat" either. While there certainly were some flat 
places, especially in the peat lands around Thorne, there also were
some definite climbs and descents mixed in as well. But yesterday's
ride had gone extremely well. A hundred and fifty of us had signed up
for the Harlow start and somewhere close to that number had actually
started at 10:00 AM on a day that featured welcome cloud cover, no rain
and an actual tail-wind. At the same time we started out, a slightly
smaller group of riders began at the Thorne Rugby Club, headed out along
the same course, but offset 296 kilometers. That group would ride north
to Dalkeith just outside Edinburgh before returning south. Later, back at
Thorne some of those riders would stop, having chosen the shorter 800
kilometer option while the rest would venture down to Harlow before looping
back up again to Thorne for the full 1400 kilometer circuit.</p>

<p>In taking the Harlow start, I was in the group containing most of
the foreigners. Harlow, just north of London, is only 20 kilometers from
Stansted airport, so it afforded the easiest access for those of us flying
in from overseas. I'd had the great fortune to connect up with an other
American, a fellow named Greg Zaborac via the internet and
we'd coordinated our travel plans. Greg had contacted Mark Brooking, a member
of the Willesden Cycle Club, and Mark had generously opened his home
in Waltham Abbey to serve as our pre-ride and post-ride staging area. Mark,
a genuine legend in audax circles for his various exploits including riding
all four Raid Alpines and setting numerous trike and tandem-trike records, 
picked us up at the airport on Wednesday and his family had made us feel
right at home. Mark's wife Alison had proven that, contrary to the stereotype,
the English can cook and made us tea and scones and lovely breakfasts and 
dinners and generally made us feel like royal guests. Mark's parents and
Alison also proudly filled us in on various rides that Mark had done but that
he was too modest to mention. Mark and Alison's lovely three year old daughter 
Wendy had cheerfully accepted these two American's into her home, making 
sure we played lots of games of balloon bounce with her, read all the 
Thunderbirds comics and gotten to know the little frogs that lived in the
garden in the back of their flat. The Brookings also took us on a walking
tour of Waltham Abbey and instructed us on the ways of the buses and the 
train so that on Thursday Greg and I were able to venture into London, tour
the Tower of London and see the Crown Jewels.</p>

<p>Greg and I met up in real life in the airport in Amsterdam where
we'd both changed planes for the final hop over to Stansted. I was leaned
back in a chair with my feet on my duffel bag when this tall fellow with
close cropped hair and a lean Lance Armstrong-esque look about him comes up
to me and says, "You wouldn't happen to have any Payday bars in that bag
now would you?" Greg proved to be the perfect travel companion: laid back, 
not too chatty but thoughtful with interesting things to say and a genuine
curiosity about this strange old part of world we were both exploring 
for the first time.</p>

<p>The Brookings answered all our questions with patience and good 
humor, although I could tell some of our inquiries provided them with
a good deal of amusement. Early on we learned that you go clockwise through
the roundabouts, that pubs stop serving food just about the time you are 
getting hungry, that Toad-in-Hole is some kind of sausage dish and that 
there isn't a border check-point between England and Scotland.</p>

<p>On Friday, Greg and I bicycled from Waltham Abbey to Harlow, a small 
journey that allowed us to accomplish many things. First, it provided us
with a chance to check out our bikes, to make certain that we'd reassembled 
them correctly and that everything was working properly. Second, it gave
us our first chance at navigating British roads, understanding the signs
and remembering to ride on the left. Third, it let us find the starting
control point and test ride the first section of the course, verifying that
we did in fact understand the notations on the cue sheets. Finally, this
trip let me deliver a lamp to my friend Mark Thomas, who was also riding
LEL but whose head lamp had been crushed in transit. Mark had been vacationing
in Italy prior to LEL but he'd called me prior to my departure once he'd
discovered his problem and now I was serving as an international courier.</p>

<p>Greg and I completed all our Friday missions and made it safely 
back to Waltham Abbey for our final pre-ride feed and briefing. At dinner
we met Mark's friend Simon Doughty, the guy who has literally written the 
book on long distance cycling. Last month, Simon had been a member of Cassie
Lowe's RAAM support crew and he entertained us with many tales from RAAM,
including sharing with us the psyche-out tidbit that whenever Cassie would
pass someone in RAAM the crew would make sure that the support van's stereo 
was blaring out Z.Z. Top's "She's Got Legs!"</p>

<p>Early on Saturday Mark, Simon, Greg and I piled the bikes on top of Mark's
car and drove over to the Harlow control. Mark and Simon were handling 
check-in duty and Greg and I headed over to the Greyhound Pub for the 
pre-ride breakfast. In general the food was pretty good but the sausage 
had a suspiciously toad-like taste. I filled up on toast and scrambled eggs.
</p>

<p>At 10:00 AM we launched out into the English countryside. The day passed 
in a blur of colored jerseys and good spirits. Knots of riders formed loosely 
affiliated packs and I was seeing old friends. Sharon and Chip Bole, Americans
who I'd first met in Paris at PBP, were riding strong. Jack Eason was there
with a bunch of his fellow Willesden Cycle Club riders. I know Jack always
finishes these things, so I knew as long as I was seeing him, I couldn't
really be off track. But I also figured that since Jack must be at least
thirty years my senior, at some point I should be able to finally leave
him behind. But Jack is a relentless rider and even though I'd make it to
each control ahead of him, he'd inevitably pull in just a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The first control was the Longstowe Village Hall, about 62 kilometers into
the ride. The Italian group was ahead of me and the most notable member of 
that crew was Mateo Luzzana, a tall fellow riding a tiny three-speed Brompton.
I'd first met Mateo and his father Luigi last year on BMB when Luigi had been
riding a Moulton and Mateo had been piloting a gorgeous custom titanium 
Moulton replica. Most of the Italians didn't speak English, so they rode
together and counted on Mateo to be their main translator. They tended to
ride quickly but the dynamics of the group slowed them down at the controls.
On the other hand, I rode slower but was mostly on my own so I didn't have
to wait for anyone. The net result was that I saw a lot of the Italians.</p>

<p>While Mateo probably had the smallest bike on the ride, there were a few
other unusual machines as well. At least three folks were riding fixed gear 
bikes including Alan "Pedals" Pedliham with his amazing psyche-out 64-tooth
front sprocket. As a sometimes fixer myself, I knew that it's the overall
ratio that counts and Pedals had a fairly rational rear cog to match that
monstrous front ring. Still, his bike did cause more than a few double-takes.
There were a couple of recumbents as well; an Optima Baron with a neat custom
tailbox made from foam camp mats and the light and lovely Mike Burrow's 
designed RatCatcher 9 with it's funky monoblade front fork, stub-mounted
rear wheel and a custom fiber-glass tailbox. And one of Mark Brooking's
buddies was riding an upright trike. There was even one other fellow besides 
me riding a Bike Friday NWT.</p>

<p>I was riding my green Bike Friday New World
Tourist, the bike I'd ridden on PBP back in 1999. I'd been planning on taking
my newer NWT, a blue one I'd picked up last fall but two weeks before LEL,
I'd cracked the rear triangle pivot on Cannonball, a 275 mile race across
Washington State. I couldn't quite figure out why my first half time on
Cannonball had been fairly fast and my second half time had been rather
dismal. Of course, that troubling creaking sound from the rear triangle
should have tipped me off.  When I went to fold up the bike, it came apart
in a way it's not supposed to and the mystery
was solved. The Bike Friday folks would fix the bike, of course, but there
wasn't time to get the work done before LEL, so I'd transfered my lights
and other rando gear to my tried and true older bike.</p>

<p>The feature of my Friday that caused the most interest were the 
mudguards. Over the course of several years of riding in the damp Pacific
Northwest, I've evolved some pretty sophisticated mudguards that are made
entirely of coroplast and zip-ties. These are light and rugged and the
Brits seemed to think that my mudguards were the greatest thing since beans on
toast. Apparently mudguards are a religious issue here in the UK and various
people stopped me to take pictures of the mud-guards and ask if I had a
patent on the design.</p>

<p>The food at the controls was variable and it'd been one of my concerns
in doing this ride. Along with my doubts about riding on the left side of
the road and navigating a ride with no on-the-road markers, the food issue
was weighing heavy on my mind. It was also weighing heavy on my bike, since
I was carrying my standard stockpile of PayDay candy bars along with some
granola bars and a small flask of honey. The honey was my second-to-last
anti-bonk ration. The ace up my sleeve was a small pile of chocolate-covered
espresso beans. With these foodstuffs, I figured I could survive in this
savage land.</p>

<p>It turned out that I found many recognizable and edible things at the
controls. Bananas, rice pudding, milk, eggs on toast all went down easily.
At the third control in Lincoln, there was a Burger King and I had some 
lovely chicken nuggets and at Thorne I got brave enough to try something
called Custard and Sponge which proved to be wonderful.</p>

<p>I'd pulled into the Thorne Rugby Club at 10:54 PM on Saturday and I
figured that that was a good day's riding, so I took a break and slept for
three hours. The official sleeping area wasn't very comfy, so I wandered
back to the main area and found a nice padded bench. One of the things
I'd learned from Jack Eason was that if you cover your eyes, it's easier
to sleep and on BMB I'd realized the wisdom of packing ear-plugs. With my
black fleece earband pulled over my eyes and my plugs in place, I had
a virtual private room and slept very peacefully.</p>

<p>I'd hit the road at 2:45 this morning and that meant I had good light
for taking pictures at Castle Howard. Now I'm rolling on toward Hovingham.</p>

<p>While yesterday had gone very well, today was showing what LEL is really
all about. It's about the lumpy bits. I'm still making pretty decent time
when I pull into Hovingham at 7:06 AM, especially considering I'd had to
stop to fix a rear puncture just outside of Stamford Bridge. I have some
vegetable lasagna and a thing called triffle (a mix of fruit, jello and a 
creamy pudding-like topping) but neither of these things really seems right
as a breakfast. I head out at 7:50 AM.</p>

<p>Now things are definitely getting lumpy. My average speed is dropping and
the wind is picking up. It's not a favorable wind. I'm continuing to ride
on my own, although I do wind up riding with people for brief sections
when our paces happen to match up. I ride some with a couple of Americans
that I knew previously via email, Larry Midura and Ed Felker.</p>

<p>I miss a turn in Middleton Tyas and waste about twenty minutes getting
back on course. I pull into the Barton Truckstop at 11:50 AM and order a
decent breakfast, a double order of eggs on toast and two pints of milk. It
turns out I couldn't down quite all that toast and eggs, but Ed Felker
helps me out. At 12:40 I'm back on the road.</p>

<p>Now I feel like a slug. The hills definitely a major feature of the 
landscape now and the wind is brutal. It's lovely scenery and I get to 
appreciate it at an average speed of 16.1 kilometers per hour. I decide
to stop looking at my average speed. I also rethink my optimistic thoughts
of making Dalkeith my next sleep break. Heck, that Tibetan temple at 
Eskadalemuir sounds interesting, maybe I'll stop there!</p>

<p>I'm not feeling great when I pull into the Youth Hostel at Langdon 
Beck. When they stamp my control card I notice that the stamp mentions
that this is "the highest youth hostel in England". Well, that would
explain why it felt like the uphills far outnumbered the downhills today!</p>

<p>Langdon Beck is an absolutely lovely control. I have some orange juice
and coffee and rice pudding and peaches and a couple of choco things and
I feel like a new man. At the start of the ride we'd been issued a pear-carob
energy bar and while I thought at the time the thing sounded revolting, once
I'd eaten it, I felt like I had more energy. They had these things for sale
here and I bought a couple.</p>

<p>The Langdon Beck control workers briefed me on what lay ahead, an 11 
kilometer climb up Yad Moss followed by a descent into Alston. Alston
features a 16% descent on rough cobbles. Thinking ahead, I realize that
tomorrow this will mean a 16% climb up those same cobbles.</p>

<p>The climb up Yad Moss is fabulous. There are loads of sheep everywhere:
beside the road, on the road, everywhere. I've never seen so many sheep. The
hills are wind-swept and the grass and heather are sheep cropped. While the
climb is definitely up, it has a rolling, up and down nature that for some
reason reminds me of the climb up to Windy Ridge on Mount Saint Helens back
home.</p>

<p>Alston is beautiful and I roll out of the Pennines, down the cobbles and
through the center of this 17th century town. Now I turn onto an A road, roll
through Brampton and on to the truckstop at Carlisle.</p>

<p>At Carlisle I scarf down a jacket potato with cheese and then press on
to Eskdalemuir. I'm feeling good and it's dark now. I've crossed over into
Scotland. I really only see the road ahead of me, but the cool air off to
my right lets me know I'm passing by a river and even in the dim light I
can see the hulking curves of the hills. I pull into the Tibetan temple
at one minute before midnight.</p>

<p>The temple at Eskdalemuir is called the Samye Ling Tibetan Centre.
"Samye" is Tibetan for "the inconceivable place" and indeed the idea of
a Tibetan temple nestled in a valley in southern Scotland is somewhat
inconceivable. Founded in 1967 by two refugee Tibetan abbots, this place
is the first Tibetan Centre in the west and it's now an international 
centre of Buddhist training. And tonight, it's serving as a control point
for Audax UK's LEL ride!</p>

<p>Greg Zaborac and Mark Thomas are at Samye Ling and they great me like
the prodigal son, "where have you been, we've been worried about you!"
"Uhh, I've been riding my bike...," I'd been feeling pretty good until now.
"We'd heard you'd gone through Barton at 4:00 AM, so we figured you were
ahead of us, but nobody at any of the other controls had seen you." "No,"
I reply, "I slept in Thorne," I check my notes, "I didn't get to Barton
until 11:50 this morning." We eventually figure out that the info they got
must have been for Ken Bonner or some similarly speedy fellow.</p>

<p>It turns out Mark and Greg had connected up back at Thorne and have
been riding together ever since. "Your buddy here doesn't sleep," Mark
informs me. For guys running on virtually no sleep, they're still looking
pretty good. "Well, I'm sleeping," I declare. I grab a couple of pieces
of delicious ginger bread and settle in for a great four hour sleep. Of
course Mark and Greg are gone when I get up but I have a breakfast of
gingerbread and coffee and at 5:00 AM, I'm back on the road.</p>

<p>Around 9:00 AM I roll into Dalkeith and I see Mark and Greg heading 
south. Mark recommends the omlette and when I get to the control I follow
up on his recommendation by having a big cheese omlette. I also have 
some rice pudding, juice and coffee. It's nice to be half done with the
ride. At 9:50 AM, I head south.</p>

<p>It's windy now and it's not a favorable wind. At 3:17 PM I'm back at
Samye Ling. I have one of the control workers snap my picture in front of
the temple and I buy a postcard that gives a large overview of the temple.
I dine on some fabulous mushroom pasta, a banana and some more of that
wonderful gingerbread. At 4:00 PM, I'm back on the road.</p>

<p>I'm feeling good and I blast on to Carlisle. Well, at 19.8 kph I'm
not exactly blasting but I am moving and that's the important thing. I
pull into the Carlisle truckstop at 6:45 PM and feast on a jacket potato
with cheese. I wash this down with a half liter of milk and a half liter
of chocolate milk. I head back out on the road at 7:25 PM.</p>

<p>My goal for tonight is Langdon Beck but twelve miles out from Carlisle
as I'm climbing yet another of the approximately seventeen billion hills that
make up this ride, my handlebars swing sickenly toward me. I have just an
instant to think "that's not right..." and I quickly pull to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>This is not good. A Bike Friday has a very small frame and to get the
bars and seat up high enough the bikes feature a long seat mast and a riser
stem. On some Fridays this riser stem is a single piece and on others it's
a straight section of tubing with a conventional stem placed in the top.
My green Friday is set up with the straight tube and a conventional stem.
Actually, the riser section isn't standard Bike Friday issue. I'd gotten
the bike used and since I needed I higher stem, I'd fabricated my own riser.
And it had been fine for several years, including a full brevet series and
PBP. It had been fine until now. Now, the cumulative effects of lots of miles
and lots of climbs has fatigued the steel to the point of failure right 
where the riser clamps into the head tube.</p>

<p>The good news is that I didn't crash, the riser didn't cut loose on
one of the many 50 kph descents and I've got at least an hour of daylight
left. I get to work.</p>

<p>I quickly realize that this isn't really too bad. A section of the riser
about three inches long is still embedded in the headtube, but I loosen the
stem from the rest of the riser tube and I extract the riser stub by using
the stem wedge as a lever. While I'm repairing things, a couple of my fellow
randonneurs ask if I'm OK as they roll by. I assure them that I have 
everything under control.</p>

<p>I undo my light assembly and invert the remaining piece of stem riser.
Even though it's three inches shorter, it's still long enough to work as
a riser. I just have to insert less of the tube into the headset and put
less of the stem quill into the tube and I can get my bars into a close
approximation of their original configuration. By inverting the tube, I
figure I've moved the most stressed section of the pipe up to where it's
re-enforced by the stem. I reconnect my light and I'm ready to go. The
whole operation took about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm cautious for the first few kilometers, but I gradually become
convinced that my roadside repair will probably hold up for the rest
of the ride. I think back to the failure of my other Bike Friday and
I realize that in both cases the areas that failed were at points where
a lot of force is concentrated via a long lever. I begin to contemplate
my next bike and it won't have any folding pivots. Yes, a folding bike
is convenient for travel but I need something that can take lots of
abuse. Prior to this ride I'd been thinking that
maybe Sandiway Fong was onto something -- go with a little light titanium
bike. I'd even priced and speced out an Airborne Carpe Diem. But, something
still didn't seem quite right. Then it occurred to me what had seemed 
wrong: I'm not a Ti-guy. I'm
a bodge-together-a-bike-out-of-spare-parts kind of guy. I'm the guy who makes
mud-guards out of coroplast. Buying a brand-spanking new bike isn't exactly
my style. Having a bike I know and the tools I need to keep it going, now 
that's my style.</p>

<p>Still, I'm thinking this is going to be my last big ride on a Friday. 
I begin mentally reviewing my stock of bike parts back at home. Maybe 
something based around a mountain bike frame. Something really tough...</p>

<p>My reverie is interrupted by Alston, that lovely market town with the 
cobbles and the 16 percent grade. It's dark now but there are still
villagers in the square as I make the right hand turn up the hill and
charge the cobbled grade. I can hear them yelling something as I pound
up the hill, something like "go you crazy American" and when I look up
I see the lights of a descending lorry bearing down on me. I think something
like "what's that idiot doing driving on the wrong side of the road?" and
in an instant I realize that I'm the idiot and that's what the townspeople
had been yelling. At the last second I dive left. The lorry misses me by 
inches.</p>

<p>It's cold now, with a bitter wind whipping across the Pennines. The
sheep are all sleeping now and most of them are off the road. The rabbits
are out in force, however. It's not hard to avoid them while I climb
slowly, but I'm nervous about the descent.</p>

<p>At the summit of Yad Moss it's astoundingly windy. I stop to pull on my
rain jacket and long-fingered gloves for warmth. With the cold wind
snapping at the fabric and my numb fingers I'm terrified that I'll drop
my jacket. The wind speed must be around 30 mph and I know if I drop the
jacket, I'll never see it again. Very carefully, I manage to pull on my 
jacket and gloves.</p>

<p>I try to flip on my Cateye high-beam for the descent but it's decided
not to work. I'd foolishly tempted fate a couple of days earlier when
Greg had asked me about the light. He and I run a similar set-up, a SON hub
pushing a Lumotec for our main light with a small AA-powered Cateye serving
as a back-up light and high beam. Greg had asked if I'd ever had any trouble
with the Cateye and I'd foolishly said, "no, it's always been super-reliable."
I should know to never say such foolish things and now my Cateye was
misbehaving. I'm not about to try any major surgery in the dark, but I do 
give the light a few good whacks to try to coax it back to life. The light
doesn't respond to my persuasion. I descend as quickly as my low beam and
the local rabbit population will allow. It isn't one of my fastest descents.</p>

<p>At 12:40 AM, I reach the Langdon Beck Youth Hostel. I find a comfy bench,
cover my eyes and ears and go to sleep. I wake up at 2:30 AM and have a
wonderful breakfast of scrambled eggs on toast and hot rice pudding. While
I'm drinking my coffee and juice, Jack Eason and some of his Willesden 
companions roll in. "Is it still cold up on Yad Moss?" I ask. "It's bitter,"
Jack tells me as he sips his tea.</p>

<p>I'm working on my Cateye light now. The human tongue can work as a crude
volt meter and it tells me I've got juice in the cells. I futz with the 
battery holder and notice that one of the contacts had slid out of its 
channel. Probably got shaken up on the cobbles. I set things right and 
reassemble power unit. The light shines out beautifully. I finish up my
coffee, buy a couple of Snickers and three pear-carob bars for the road
and head out. It's 3:00 AM.</p>

<p>It's raining lightly as I leave, but it's a light Seattle-style rain
and it stops after half an hour. Soon the sun rises and at 6:10 AM I
take a quick break at the Barton Truckstop (by the way, why don't they
call them Lorrystops here?). My Langdon Beck breakfast and Snickers bars
have done a good job of keeping my fueled so I only stop long enough to
get my card stamped and swig down a pint of chocolate milk here. I press
on to Hovingham.</p>

<p>Of course there are hills but I'm in Hovingham a bit before 
11:00 AM and I have a great lunch of pasta and cheese, some lovely
cream of chicken soup, coffee and orange juice. At noon I'm rolling
again, climbing up and over the grounds of Castle Howard and finally
leaving the worst of the lumpy bits behind me. Now the land really
is flatter. I roll by the big nuclear plant and through swarms of
tiny little midges. The last section into Thorne seems to take
forever and I'm pretty darn tired when I pull in.</p>

<p>It's hot in the control and I have a sponge custard and a banana. I
chat for a bit with Ian Humphries, an Australian recumbent triker who 
I'd first met back on PBP. Ian's one of those wise fellows who'd chosen
to ride the 800K northern option and he's done and happy. I still have
kilometers to ride, so I indulge in one of my luxuries and switch to my
spare pair of socks. At 5:55 PM, I head out for the Lincoln control.</p>

<p>I pull into the Lincoln control at 9:50 PM and this proves to be
a fortunate thing as the control worker there tells me that the
Burger King will close in ten minutes. I hustle over there and get some
chicken nuggets, a large fries and and orange drink. I eat the nuggets and
half the fries, saving the rest and part of the orange drink for breakfast.
I inquire about the sleeping arrangements here and I'm told that I can share
a room with the Germans and Austrians and they'll be getting up 
around 4:00 AM. This is perfect. If there hadn't been any room 
at the inn, I was perfectly willing
to camp out in my thermolite bivy but having a room with a real bed was
a welcome luxury.</p>

<p>I got up at 4:00 and breakfasted on the cold french fries and orange
drink. I see Mark and Greg's bikes and deduce that they pulled in sometime
after I had. I think I'd slipped past them by taking a short sleep break
at Langdon Beck and I'd been running slightly ahead of them all yesterday. At
4:30 AM I roll out.</p>

<p>Cold french fries don't make much of a breakfast and I'm dragging. 
All along the trip I've been fueling en route with PayDay bars, the 
pear-carob bars, granola bars and the occasional shot from my flask
of honey but now I could really use some coffee. Britain isn't known for
its coffee shops and our rural route, while scenic is a little short on
the accoutrements of civilization. Then I remember that I have a stash 
of chocolate-covered espresso beans buried somewhere in my pack. I dig 
them out and down a handful. Now it feels like morning!</p>

<p>I'm not to far from Thurlby when I see a rider stopped at a corner. He's
looking down at his fender and when I stop to see if he needs anything and
he looks up at me I see he's scraped up and bleeding. "I don't know what
happened," he says in German or Austrian-accented English and I can see he's
looking kind of dazed. I look at the gravel in the corner and piece it
together. "You must've slipped on the gravel and crashed. Are you OK?"
He's more concerned about his rear fender which has gotten knocked out of
place and is rubbing on his rear tire. We get that fixed and while we're
working on it, he looks at me and says "Kent Peterson?" "Yeah..." I say
not sure where this is going. "I've been to your website!" Somehow knowing
me through the web seems to make this fellow feel better, or maybe it's
just having anybody around. "Will you ride with me to the next control?"
"Sure," I reply, "no problem." Mark and Greg pull up while we're still working
on getting the fender right and my German-or-Austrian friend cleans his wounds.
The four of us ride off together and make our way to Thurlby.</p>

<p>At Thurlby the control workers take care of our injured companion and the
rest of us dig into the food. I have more eggs on toast and a couple of
helpings of rice pudding and two cups of coffee. I also buy four more of
the carob-pear bars which Greg declares to be "disgusting". "Yeah," I agree,
"but the damn things work. They've really grown on me!"
</p>

<p>It's warm now and getting warmer. At 10:00 AM I blast off toward Longstowe,
the penultimate control. I manage to hit heavy traffic in St. Neots and I get 
a bit lost but I get things sorted out and I make it to Longstowe at 3:28 PM,
a bit ahead of Greg and Mark. They come in with a fellow named David and we're
all looking a little ragged at this point. The bearings are going in Mark's 
front wheel and he's doing way too much work now. One of the control workers
helps him out by loaning him a wheel. Since Mark's front wheel is one of
those famous (and expensive) SON generator hubs this means his main light
is now gone, but we're going to finish up in daylight so this isn't a
problem.</p>

<p>As usual, I don't wait around and blast out of the control a bit ahead
of the others. I get a little off course, miss the turn to Much Hadham and
wind up in the village of Little Hadham. I realize my error and navigate
my way back to the course. I think to myself "Little Hadham, Much Hadham,
heck, I've had 'em all!" After nearly 1400 kilometers this strikes me as
amazingly funny. When you spend this much time on the bike, you take your
amusement where you find it. David and I connect up for the very last
bit of navigation into Harlow.</p>

<p>We pull into the Harlow control at 7:35 PM on Wednesday July 25, 2001.
According to the route sheet, I've covered 1416.7 kilometers in the past
105 hours 35 minutes. The time limit for the ride is 115 hours. My odometer
lists the ride I made, including a few episodes of getting lost, at 1440
kilometers. As all the Brits will tell you the time doesn't matter, just
finishing within the limit is the name of the game. Mark Brooking is there
at the end and he stamps my control card for the last time and gives me
my finisher's patch. I let him know that Greg and Mark aren't far behind
me and sure enough a few minutes later they roll in.</p>

<p>LEL is an amazing ride. The terrain is beautiful but brutal. It's not just
longer than PBP or BMB, it's tougher. In fact I'd say that the northern 800K
of LEL is about as hard as doing the 1200 km of BMB. But it's definitely a
ride worth doing. I'll probably be back in 2005.</p>

<p>Post ride note: Mark Thomas is more observant than I am and he informs
me that I'm no good at identifying foreign accents. The injured rider was
Jukka Salonen of Finland. Jukka recovered nicely. I was only a few kilometers
past the Thurlby control when I saw him blast by me on his way to a strong
finish at Harlow.</p>
