LEAGUE OF AMERICAN WHEELMAN d/b/a LEAUGE OF AMERICAN BICYCLISTS ("LAB")
RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT
("AGREEMENT")
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
IN CONSIDERATION of being permitted to participate in any way in Seattle
International Randonneurs ("Club") and Randonneurs USA ("RUSA") sponsored
Bicycling Activities ("Activity"), I, for myself, my personal
representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin:
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
1. ACKNOWLEDGE, agree, and represent that I understand the nature of the
activity and that I am qualified, in good health, and in proper physical
condition to participate in such Activity. I further agree and warrant that
if at any time I believe conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately
discontinue further participation in the Activity.
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
2. FULLY UNDERSTAND that: (a) the ACTIVITY INVOLVES RISKS AND DANGERS OF
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, PARALYSIS AND DEATH
("RISKS"); (b) these Risks and dangers may be caused by my own actions, or
inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in the Activity,
the condition in which the Activity takes place, or THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
"RELEASEES" NAMED BELOW; (c) there may be OTHER RISKS AND SOCIAL AND
ECONOMIC LOSSES either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this
time; and I FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LOSSES, COSTS, AND DAMAGES I incur as a result of my participation in
the Activity.
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
3. HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE the Club, RUSA, the
LAB, their respective administrators, directors, agents, officers, members,
volunteers, and employees, other participants, any sponsors, advertisers,
and, if applicable, owners and lessors of premises on which the Activity
takes place, (each considered one of the "RELEASEES" herein) FROM ALL
LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ON MY ACCOUNT CAUSED OR
ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
"RELEASEES" OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING NEGLIGENT RESCUE OPERATIONS; AND I
FURTHER AGREE that if, despite this RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY,
ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT I, or anyone on my behalf, makes
a claim against any of the Releasees, I WILL INDEMNIFY, SAVE, AND HOLD
HARMLESS EACH OF THE RELEASEES from any litigation expenses, attorney fees,
loss, liability, damage, or cost which any may incur as the result of such
claim.
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I
HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT, AND HAVE SIGNED IT FREELY
AND WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT OR ASSURANCE OF ANY NATURE AND INTEND IT TO BE A
COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
ALLOWED BY LAW AND AGREE THAT IF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT IS HELD TO BE
INVALID THE BALANCE, NOTWITHSTANDING, SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND
EFFECT.
</P>

Reminder: All riders are reminded that any failure to conduct the ride in
accordance with SIR Brevet Rider Expectations, RUSA rules, applicable laws,
or any special instructions or equipment requirements for this ride may
result in a time penalty or disqualification.
