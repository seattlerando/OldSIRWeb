<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Special Events</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Saturday night will feature a banquet 
at Garlinis restaurant, time will probably be around 6pm, but that’s 
still TBD. After we’re through enjoying the meal, we’ll gather for 
the White Elephant Bike Part Exchange. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What’s a White Elephant exchange?  
Everyone brings a wrapped gift – the gift is mostly a gag and pretty 
inexpensive.  Some examples of gifts include a bag of tubes that 
need patching or a solid rubber tire.  All the gifts are put on 
a common table.  Each person can either choose a gift or the gift 
from someone who’s already opened theirs. Why is it called a White 
Elephant?  Good question – I don’t know!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Monday will feature a group photo before 
the ride and distribution of 5x7 photos after the ride.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Lodging</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Inn At The River has group rooms 
available under the group name of Northwest Crank.  The rates there 
are approximately $60/night (+tax) for a single, and $80/night for a 
double (+tax). Phone number is 800-920-5406.  This rate is good 
for booking until April 7<sup>th</sup> and then the rooms are freed 
up and the rates go back to normal.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For more hotels, please check </font><a href="http://www.wenatcheevalley.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>www.wenatcheevalley.org</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Food</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are plenty of restaurants nearby 
from fast food to nice restaurants.  A favorite from 2006 was Garlini’s 
Italian restaurant just down the street from Inn at the River. Shari’s 
is just down the street.  Starbucks is a block away for those who 
need their morning coffee fix.  There’s a grocery store a block 
away as well.  There are plenty of other restaurants within walking 
distance.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For dinner each evening we will have 
a recommended meeting time at the Inn at the River.  From there 
groups can choose where they want to go for dinner.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Family Activities</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bring your family or spouse along and 
make a family outing of the weekend.  Wenatchee itself has plenty 
of activities.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cashmere has Aplets and Cotlets.  
Leavenworth has some mini-golf and the charm of Bavarian architecture.  
Go rafting or visit one of the many museums.  Lake Chelan is beautiful 
and close by.  There’s plenty of hiking or mountain biking as 
well.  Or take the day and head to the Yakima Valley for some wine 
tasting. Take advantage of the ample opportunities for exploring the 
area and having fun.  For information, go to </font><a href="http://www.wenatcheevalley.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>www.wenatcheevalley.org</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">.  For information on the Wenatchee Apple

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>About Brevets, Populaires, and Control 
Cards</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sunday’s and Monday’s rides are being 
organized under the history, traditions, and rules of randonneuring, 
specifically the Audax Club Parisian and Randonneurs USA (</font><a href="http://www.rusa.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>www.rusa.org</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">) which is the US organization.  The Seattle 
International Randonneurs is a local chapter of RUSA.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to verify that riders have completed 
a brevet, controls and control cards are used.  Controls are points 
along a route where you must stop and get your control card signed.  
Some controls are manned which means that your card will be signed by 
a volunteer.  Other controls at “OPEN” which means that you 
can go to any business in the control town and have someone sign your 
card.  Using the control cards will give you an idea of how brevets 
are run if you choose to do more SIR events; it’s not necessary for 
your to use the control cards during Northwest Crank.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Those who complete the 200km/125mi ride 
on Sunday using the control card are eligible to earn a medal.  
To receive a medal you must be a member of SIR  (</font><a href="http://www.seattlerandonneurs.org/members.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>www.seattlerandonneurs.org<WBR>/members.html</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">) and you must be a member of Randonneurs USA 
(</font><a href="http://www.rusa.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial"><u>www.rusa.org</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">); medals are $8.  As a member of SIR you 
are entitled to a newsletter, a variety of web resources, and discounts 
on all SIR rides.</font> <br></p>
