<b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b>                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $10.00 to join SIR as an email-notice-only member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a U.S.P.S. mail-notice member.  Also, all SIR members must join <A HREF="http://www.rusa.org/">Randonneurs USA (RUSA)</A> to ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>. Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding. Helmets are required on all SIR events.
<p>
<B>Bag Drop:</B> There will be a bag drop service to the overnight stop at the Elma motel.</p>
<p>
<B>Note to riders intending to ride straight through without sleeping in Elma:</B>  the control at base of Tahuya Hills will be SIR staffed all night, but the Potlatch, Seabeck, and Port Gamble stores are not open all night.  There will be informational controls at these locations, but riders should make sure to carry adequate water and food to compensate for lack of services when the stores are closed.
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Downtown Seattle:  Alaskan Way at Dearborn Street  (three blocks south of the Seattle Ferry Terminal)  Free parking is available on Alaskan Way south of Dearborn Street.<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Same.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> A new route in 2005:  from the Seattle waterfront we¹ll ride east through downtown and across Mercer Island to May Valley Road, head south to Enumclaw, then follow the RAMROD route through Eatonville and Elbe, turning south on Skate Creek Road.  At Packwood, we¹ll head west through Morton and Centralia, to an overnight stop in Elma.  From Elma, we ride north through the woods to Potlatch, then along the Hood Canal to the beloved Tahuya hills, continuing north to Port Gamble, then east for the final leg to the Bainbridge Ferry terminal.   A leisurely ferry ride completes the circuit back to downtown Seattle.

The final route sheet may change, so please rely on the route sheet, not the maps. The cumulative climbing figures should be taken with a large grain of salt. The Topo USA software is notorious for overstating the cumulative altitude gain....
