<b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b>                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.
<p>
<b>Special Instruction:</b>
<p>
Please note that this ride is FRIDAY-SATURDAY, not Sat-Sun. Along with the start in remote Darrington, this will allow the ride to be run together with the 1000km ride, both will share the Friday night overnight in Pateros. There will be a bag drop service and motel rooms at the recommended overnight stop in Pateros.
<p>
See last year's <a href="../1000km/1000km_1_2002Notes.html">1000 km pre-ride notes</a> for more details on services, etc. Updated notes will be posted after the organizer's pre-ride.
<p>
Stopping in Pateros (supported) or in Winthrop or Mazama (unsupported) is highly recommended. Services will be a real challenge for riders attempting to ride straight through without stopping.

<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are a must or you'll face the scorn and abuse of your fellow randonneurs. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Let Mark know if you need a place to stay the night before before the start.
<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Mark Thomas residence. Post-ride nap space, food, and showers available (bring a towel).
<p>
