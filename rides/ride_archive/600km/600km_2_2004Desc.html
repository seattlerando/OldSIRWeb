<b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b>                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are a must or you'll face the scorn and abuse of your fellow randonneurs. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> We will be traversing the Olympic Pennisula using a counter clockwise direction starting from Olympia, WA.  After a very brief tour of the State Capital and downtown Olympia, we will merge onto Hwy 101 and head north to Quilcene.  From "Quil" use Center Rd to the Port Hadlock Controle.  Meander a few back roads to merge back onto Hwy 101 to the Port Angeles Controle.  Listen up to some advice here:  the next two controls are approximately 100K apart with no services in between. So take an extra water bottle and extra food out of Port Angeles.  Might be good advice to have somewhat of a "sit down" meal in PA as well, because you will run the next 180K mostly at night (did I say to make sure your lights are working).  From Port Angeles we will take SR-112 out to the Clallam Bay Controle and then return to Hwy 101 via Burnt Mtn Rd.   At about 390K you will arrive at Kalaloch Lodge the night rest stop.  A very small bag drop will be provided. From Kalaloch, we continue on Hwy 101 to Aberdeen.  From Aberdeen we head east using Hwy 12 and the Monte Elma rd to Elma.  From Elma we jog a little SSE via South Bank Rd to the Porter Controle.  After cutting through the Capital Forest it's just a short hop back into Olympia.
