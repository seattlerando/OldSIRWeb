<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=4>
<font size=3 color=black>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT width="100%">

<p>I had not originally planned to ride the SIR 1000 km.  My final original plan, for this season, was to peak at the Gold Rush, and then to taper off with RAMROD and RSVP.  Alas, the Gold Rush came, for me, to an abrupt early end ­ I DNFed after about 500 kms.  That left me feeling a bit restless and stymied.</p>
<p>Afterwards I moped for a few weeks, then noted that the SIR 1000 km began on the night of my 50th birthday (August 16, 2001).  I took that to be an omen Š and decided to give the ride a shot.  I was nervous that I might jinx my efforts by broadcasting my intentions, so I kept all of this pretty hush hush.  Plus, I wanted to keep my options open in case something came up (like laundry, grocery shopping, whatever excuse I could find to get me out of another long, torturous ride).</p>
<p>The 22:00 start time made me particularly nervous because my DNF, on the GRR, was the result of not getting enough sleep (physically I had been in good shape and was left hungry for more miles when I DNFed).</p>
<p>I couldn't get out of work the day of the 1000 km (in fact, I even had to come in early, thereby producing even more sleep deprivation by the start of the ride).  After the work day was over, some friends had a semi-surprise party for me at Golden Gardens.  I got so caught up in the party that I had to be reminded that I needed to get on my bike if I was going to catch the ferry to Bainbridge.  Jan Heine came along and towed me to Coleman Dock (downtown Seattle ferry terminal).</p>
<p>At the terminal there was a huge turn-out ­ four people -- Terry Zmrhal (the organizer), Mark Thomas (he said he didn't get enough miles on LEL), and Bill Dusler (who insisted that he HAD been riding since the 400 km).  The ferry was a bit late, which meant we wouldn't have to stand around at Bainbridge for very long.</p>
<p>At the start (downtown Winslow, on Bainbridge Island) we were met by John Campbell, who lives in Port Orchard.  John is 59 years young.  He told me he had done NO brevets this season.  Aha!  He would be fresh!  His bike was lean and mean; my bike included the kitchen sink (in the Carradice bag).</p>
<p>We started off in the dark, under partly clear skies, warm weather.  Dick and Mark took turns at the front, setting a brisk pace.  We quickly crossed the island and then the bridge at Agate Passage.  After passing through the outskirts of Poulsbo it was dark in the rural area, and one could not see the camels that reside on Big Valley Road.</p>
<p>The Hood Canal bridge was as much fun as ever.  After that we were doing some big hills and John and I fell back a ways.  Center Road greeted us with it's signature chip seal.  At Quilcene we had our first control, staffed by Terry.  Bill and Mark departed, shortly after we arrived.  John and I had a bit to eat, replenished our water bottles, and set off, north on Highway 101.</p>  
<p>At Highway 20 we headed east to Port Townsend.  At the supermarket there (a control) we arrived just as Mark and Bill were leaving.  I dined on a terriyaki burrito and some tapioca pudding (the contents of which were all at least five syllables).</p>
<p>Then John and I headed out, retracing our route on Highway 20.  There was very little traffic.  When we reached Highway 101 again we headed west this time, toward Sequim.</p>
<p>I had to fight the desire to turn around and go home to bed.  A bit before dawn John noted that I was dragging and suggested we catch a nap.  He said its often a good way to trick the body ­ fall asleep just before the sun comes up, sleeping for only a few minutes, then awaking and having it be daylight.</p>
<p>We found a community center and went around to the back, where there was a nice, comfortable concrete pad.  We slept for 25 minutes, then headed off.  I had to admit I felt somewhat better.</p>
<p>The daylight did wonders for John.  His speed increased greatly, and I was struggling to keep up with him.  By Sequim he asked if I wanted to stop for breakfast, mentioning that he was indifferent.  I said I could wait 'til Port Angeles.</p>
<p>We continued on, though John was now quite a bit faster than me and he disappeared over the next hill.  At Port Angeles I found a café, downtown, and went in for breakfast.  It was still early enough that the town seemed to be mostly asleep.</p>
<p>After breakfast I headed out of town and discovered a huge climb to get back up to Highway 101.  Once back on the highway it seemed that breakfast had picked up my energy level and my pace seemed fine.  Eventually I reached Crescent Lake.</p>
<p>The road along Lake Crescent is narrow, winding and with a shoulder that is less wide that one's handlebars ... at those places where there IS a shoulder.  The lanes are grooved, as if there are plans to pave them, but apparently those grooves have been there almost as long as the lake itself.  But the lake is gorgeous and my appreciation for the route continued to grow.</p>
<p>Half way along the lake was the secret control, staffed by Terry.  We chatted a bit, I took on some water, a bit of food, and was on my way.  Terry said he'd next see me at the hotel room in Aberdeen.</p>
<p>While travelling along Lake Crescent, I noted a crescent wrench on the shoulder.  A coincidence?</p>
<p>Just before the end of the lake, while I was on a section that included a slow vehicle pull-out, a car jumped behind me and slammed on the brakes, just before hitting me.  This startled me quite a bit.  Then I noted the reason for the driver's sudden move ­ an oncoming car was passing and had apparently either not bothered to look for on-coming traffic, or was a homicidal maniac (your choice).</p>
<p>Leaving Lake Crescent there was more climbing as the route headed inland toward Forks.</p>
<p>A bit north of forks I stopped to take an afternoon power nap.  It went fairly well.  This boosted my confidence and calmed some of my worries about sleep deprivation catching up with me.</p>
<p>A visit to Forks always leaves me feeling a bit depressed, probably because the place itself is a bit depressed.  There are lots of boarded-up businesses.  Apparently times have improved, however, so residents probably look at the bright side of things.</p>
<p>I saw John's bike, outside of a convenience store, and stopped there to get my card sign.  John and I chatted a bit, before he headed out.  I removed my stashed burrito, from the Carradice, and consumed it, along with a few amendments from the store.  Then I was on the bike again and heading south, catching a good descent to the Hoh River valley.  At that point Highway 101 follows the How, southwest, to the coast.</p>
<p>Along the coast stretch of 101 were great glimpses of the beaches.  Shortly after Kalaloch the highway turns inland and one climbs the Massif Central of the Olympic Peninsula, bound for Lake Quinault.</p>
<p>This stretch went through the Quinault Indian Reservation.  Most of this area had been logged off and the scenery was rather bleak.  The shoulder was very narrow, the lane was covered with chip seal, and the chip seal also covered half of the shoulder.  The smooth portion of the shoulder (i.e. that part NOT covered by chip seal) was too narrow to negotiate, so I had to stay on the chip seal.  Occasionally a large logging truck went by, at high speed.  Even though there was no oncoming traffic, some of these trucks would not move over an inch.  Perhaps they were making some statement Š which was lost on me.</p>
<p>At this point my hands were starting to feel numb.</p>
<p>At Amanda Park I got some "food" from a convenience store and had my last meal before night fall.  Then I put on reflective gear, turned on the lights, and headed out.  It was 42 miles to Aberdeen, and it would be done in the dark.</p>
<p>As the sun set the sleepiness set in.  I took a fair number of power naps on this stretch.  The challenge was to not get caught up in blackberry bushes when I laid down on the ground.  The naps became more frequent as I got closer to Hoquiam.  Finally I saw the aurora of the Hoquiam ­ Aberdeen metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Then I reached the Hoquiam city limits and the bright lights meant I would be able to stay awake for the rest of the distance to Aberdeen.
<p>The control, in Aberdeen, was an AM-PM convenience store.  I had a bit to eat there, then went several blocks to our room (the Red Lion).  It was 01:00 Saturday.  I had been biking now for 27 hours (with a few breaks).  Terry greeted me at the door.  We whispered so as not to wake a sleeping John.  Mark and Bill were getting ready to leave.</p>
<p>I took a shower and got 1H50 of sleep.  Then John and I headed out.</p>
<p>We found a bridge, over the Chehalis River, and picked up Highway 105 toward Westport.  There was a fair amount of traffic along the south side of Grays Harbor.  Westport was a control so we got our cards signed at a convenience store.  Then we headed south along Highway 105, along the coast.</p>
<p>John and I were trading war stories when we discovered that we had met before.  Small world.</p>
<p>I started to feel drowsy, so said 'good-bye' to John and took a power nap behind a small building.  I got back on the road and a car with three young men approached very quickly, actually moving as close to me as the could, then screaming as they went by at high speed.  Good, clean fun.</p>
<p>The route turned inland, along Willapa Bay, toward Tokeland.  I took another power nap.  The bay narrowed and there were great views to the other side.  Lots of birds were present in this area.</p>
<p>I arrived at the city of Raymond.  The famous Raymond steel sculptures <http://visit.willapabay.org/pages/communities/raymond.html>., depicting the heritage of Raymond, abounded.  My favorite was the herd of deer, including one REAL DEER that happened to be passing through the metallic herd just as I biked by!  How did they do that?  </p>
<p>I left the route and went downtown, hunting for breakfast.  I found a pleasant restaurant and ordered lots of food.  When I left the restaurant my spirits had been picked up greatly.  There was something pleasant about Raymond and I made a note to come back for a more casual visit.  </p>
<p>As I was leaving the downtown area the effects of having consumed much water and orange juice at breakfast became apparent.  Just as my eyeballs were starting to swim I came upon a small park, overlooking the river.  It had a facility, right by the road.  I was liking this community more and more.</p>
<p>Funny thoughts go through one's head during these long miles on the road.  Perhaps the French origins of randonneuring cause one to often be thinking about all things French.  In any case, I started wondering how the French would pronounce Raymond.  I came up with something that sounded like Ramone, as in "The Ramones."  For the next several miles that silly line from the movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" kept going through my head ­ "Do your parents know you're The Ramones!?"</p>
<p>The route then picked up Highway 101 again and I continued west, along the Willapa River, then again along Willapa Bay.  A good portion of this day was to be spent along Willapa Bay and Willapa National Wildlife Refuge.  A very scenic area.</p>
<p>A long, narrow peninsula protects Willapa Bay from the ocean.  There were great views, across the bay, to that thin stretch of land.</p>
<p>I crossed the Naselle River and was starting an uphill when a pickup, with camper, heading the opposite direction, nearly failed to negotiate a hard right turn, while attempting to pass on a steep downhill stretch of the highway.  By the time I noticed it the vehicle seemed to be up on two wheels and headed across the oncoming lane towards me.  Fortunately the driver took very firm hold of the steering wheel, at the last moment, and brought the vehicle under control..</p>
<p>I reached the narrow peninsula, at Seaview, and headed north toward Ocean Park.  The traffic was very heavy here.  The towns were filled with vacationers.  Fortunately the drivers were fairly well behaved.  At Ocean Park I ran into John Campbell.  He was doing well.  We wished each other a good ride and pressed on.  I found a small restaurant, set back from the main drag, with pizza by the slice.  They even had Hansen's strawberry smoothies.  I got my card signed, too.  I even schmoozed a bit with the proprietrice.  Life was good.</p>
<p>Then it was back on the bike.  The route headed south, to Ilwaco, at the southern end of the thin peninsula.  From there it was Highway 101 again, to Chinook (a control).  At the store they asked me for my control card before I could even get it out.  One advantage of being a bit slower is that the other riders prep the control people!</p>
<p>Just south of Chinook, on Highway 101, comes the first view of the mouth of the Columbia and the Astoria bridge.  This is truly a dramatic scene.  I had never been here before and had no idea how wide the Columbia River is at it's mouth.</p>
<p>Most of the traffic stayed on 101, going south onto the bridge.  The route, however, continued east, on Highway 401, along the north shore of the Columbia River.  There were lots of birds in this area.  A slight tail wind carried me along.  Finally the highway turned north and I climbed out of the Columbia River Valley and headed toward Naselle.</p>
<p>Returning toward Raymond, I stopped at the Hunan Restaurant, in South Bend (Pacific County seat), which is connected to Raymond along the Willapa River.  The woman who waited on me was very interested in my ride.  She also was amenable to putting tofu in my Chow Mein, even asking me how I wanted the tofu prepared: cooked in with the food our sauteed lightly, by itself.  Life was good, though I did come away worrying that putting tofu in one's Chow Mein just might be gauche.</p>
<p>She seemed amazed that I would be taking Highway 101 back to Aberdeen, saying that it was like a roller coaster.  Little did I know how right she was!</p>
<p>It was a tough roller coaster to be hallucinating on.  Fortunately I had NO drowsy periods, as finding a spot for a power nap might have been difficult.  It was very dark and the drop-offs seemed very steep and endless.  The first 17 miles of the 24 miles back to Aberdeen were VERY memorable.</p>
<p>At one point I came across an intersection with lights and stopped under one of the lights to work on my own lights (the batteries to the main light had died).  A couple of cars were across the highway, under the other light.</p>

<img align=right border=0 src="1000km.gif">

<p>"Hey!  You wanna get high?" one of the people called out to me.</p>
<p>"That's tempting," I shouted back, "but I'm having a tough enough time at the moment as it is.  But thanks, though," I said in a polite tone.  No need to seem unappreciative to the natives.</p>
I considered the consequences of "inhaling":<br>
1 toke	- Can't remember which direction to Aberdeen<br>
2 tokes	- Can't remember why I was going to Aberdeen in the first place<br>
3 tokes	- Couldn't care less.</p>
<p>It would be tough to say "I didn't inhale," especially with all of this steep uphill.</p>

<p>I adjusted my lights and headed on.  Geez, if nothing else, being asked if I wanted to get high was a big change from the cars that would drive by and have occupants scream at me.  Fortunately, the latter incidents were rare, however.</p>
<p>A few more roller coaster climbs/descents and I arrived at Cosmopolis.  From here it was city lights all the way to the hotel room.  I arrived at 23:40 Saturday.</p>
<p>Terry greeted me at the door.  Again just some brief whispering, though Terry's face lit up when I told him that the day's scenery had been spectacular.  A quick shower, a quick sandwich, and I was in bed, down for a three hour count.  I briefly heard the other three get up to leave, about an hour before I planned to get up.</p>
<p>I was out the door, on the road, cruisin' for D cells.  I would probably have been fine with one light, but I kind of like a bit of light on the road.  I'm funny that way.  I struck out at AM PM, though Safeway was just down the road and I probably saved a bundle.</p>
<p>The route went east, on Highway 12.  It was dark Š but there was NO traffic.  After 11 miles I arrived at Montesano, where the route heads into the heart of this county seat and then takes a quiet back road that parallels Highway 12.  It was very quiet.  Somewhere east of Montesano the daylight started to arrive.</p>
<p>I went through the interesting town of McCleary.  It had the appearance of being a company town.  Lots of very small houses that all look the same, one very large, fancy house, and one big mill (Simpson).  The curious thing, however, is that each of the little houses, though plain and generally somewhat in need of repair, had a very interesting, very modern looking (and probably expensive) front door.  No two doors were the same.</p>
<p>In front of the plant was a sign with the name (Simpsons) and also the name of a current collaborator, whose specialty is doors!  Perhaps there is an employee discount, or bonus, or something, to explain these expensive doors in these plain houses.</p>
<p>Shortly after McCleary I took my final power nap of the ride.</p>
<p>Eventually the route connected to Highway 101 and I was headed north, with a fair bit of traffic.  It was a glorious Sunday morning in summer and everyone was out.  There was a control at Shelton, a Dennys, and I stopped for a big breakfast.  Life started to fall into place as I dined on the various dishes before me on the table.</p>
<p>Once back on the road I started to worry because I could not see any highway signs.  My tired mind started thinking that perhaps I was NOT on Highway 101.  Eventually I saw a mile post, something in the 300 range, and realized there was only ONE highway in the state with milepost numbers this high.  I settled down and got back into the groove of riding with heavy traffic and little shoulder.</p>
<p>Just a few miles north of Shelton, Highway 101 reaches the southern end of the Hood Canal and follows it's western shore.  There were many boarded-up fireworks stands on the Skokomish Indian reservation.</p>
<p>It was a little after noon (12:21 p.m., to be exact) when IT happened:</p>
<p>There was, curiously enough, a slight lull in traffic.  I was a bit north of Eldon, a bit south of Brinnon.  A group of four or five motorcycles went by, working a double pace line in the northbound lane.  I noticed them because one machine was a bright yellow, with lots of chrome.  They weren't going particularly fast, though I suppose they were following each other a bit closely.</p>
<p>They passed by and I went back to watching the shoulder.  Then I heard the screech of tires and the impact.  It wasn't a car on car impact, so I knew that one of the motorcycles had hit something.  I looked up, as soon as I heard the sound, but we were in a curve and the squadron was just far enough around the bend to be out of sight.</p>
<p>As I came around the curve all of the motorcycles were stopped, in the lane.  No one was down, everyone looked fine.  There was an SUV stopped in the southbound lane.  I could see no immediately obvious sign of impact on his vehicle.</p>
<p>The SUV moved ahead, slowly, and off to the side of the road.  Then I saw the motorcycle and driver, all tangled together, laying down in the far ditch.  The person was not moving and I feared that he was dead.</p>
<p>Another motorcyclists ran over, scooped the body up in his arms, cradled it, and started crying out, "Oh honey, HONEY, don't leave me, DON'T LEAVE ME!"</p>
<p>I then realized the downed cyclist was a woman.  I was somewhat overcome by the scene and did not have the stomach to go closer, nor could I figure out how I might be of help.  People came running from the houses along the water (Hood Canal).  Everyone trying to use a cell phone was discovering that this was a dead zone.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that there had, miraculously, been NO cars, in either direction, for some time now.  This couldn't last forever.  I yelled out that I was going a bit up the road (north) and would flag the on-coming, southbound traffic to slow it down.  I was even wearing my reflective sash, which imparted a somewhat official demeanor to my otherwise unassuming randonneur personna.</p>
<p>Residents agreed to run back to their houses and phone 911.  It was precisely 15 minutes, from time of impact, that the first two emergency vehicles arrived.  Then went down to the victim and suddenly she started screaming, in a very loud voice.  This lasted for about a minute.  I took this to be a good sign.</p>
<p>A fireman arrived, got flares from some of the emergency vehicle people, and went a bit north of where I was, around the bend, to set the flares.</p>
<p>More emergency vehicles arrived.  The southbound lane was now blocked.  People were flagging, near the victim, allowing traffic to pass in only one direction at a time.</p>
<p>Word came up to me that the motorcyclist had somehow crossed the center line, just before the end of the curve, and had collided head-on with the SUV.  She was going to be airlifted out.  Sometime later a helicopter came by, flying very high overhead.  Word was that the helicopter could not land here, so the victim was to be transported south, a few miles, in one of the medic vehicles, to where there was space for a landing.</p>
<p>I started worrying about the next control (Port Hadlock) but didn't want to abandon my post for fear that a car would come speeding around the bend and crash into the tail end of the stopped line of cars.  It must be admitted that spending an hour telling car drivers to slow down held a peculiar satisfaction for me.</p>
<p>I was truly amazed at how often a car would come around the blind curve, after having seen the flares, being on a double yellow line, and trying to look for a chance to pass the car in front.  Most drivers were very well behaved, but it was disconcerting to see just how many true idiots were on the road.</p>
<p>After about an hour the victim was taken away and most of the emergency vehicles departed soon after.  The southbound lane was still blocked however, as several police officers were spray-painting marks on the pavement and taking measurements.</p>
<p>I walked back to the scene, chatted a bit with three of the motorcyclists (who were filling out accident forms), got my bike, and got back on the road.  I was tired enough to be mostly confused by this whole incident, though eventually, as the shock of it all set in, I became a bit gun shy, very much aware of how much traffic was on the highway and of how narrow the shoulder was.</p>
<p>I climbed Walker Pass and then did a fast descent into Quilcene.  At Quilcene Highway 101 and I kissed and said 'good-bye.'  It had been a great weekend fling, for both of us, but now things had to come to an end.  This highway wasn't the type I could see myself in a long term situation with ­ rough in too many places, narrow in too many places, prone to up and down mood swings, and the real kicker was the in-your-face, head-on attitude.  Still, I left Š knowing I'd be back again some day.</p>
<p>The route continued north on Center Road (resplendent in its display of chip seal).  There was a big climb, out of Quilcene, and then the road settled down to gentle rollers.  Just before going under Highway 104 I passed by the site of the Olympic Music Festival, where a concert of classical music was taking place.  I listened carefully but the sounds did NOT carry out to Center Road.  Then again, its tough to hear anything above the constant drone of cycling on chip seal.  It was probably best that the concert-goers were insulated from the sounds of the highway ­ the noise of cars could be disCONCERTing.</p>
<p>Among the many concert-goers' cars parked along the side of the road, I noted one with a tandem bicycle and a tandem kayak on top of the rack.</p>
<p>As I passed under Highway 104 a terrible sight greeted me ­ fresh chip seal.  "My God," I exclaimed, "just how much chip seal do these people need!?"  Here they were putting chip seal on top of chip seal.  For a brief moment I thought this was all some sinister practical joke played out by members of the Redmond Cycling club (all of whom, I am SURE, share my loathing of Center Road) and that the fresh chip seal would end in a few hundred feet.  Alas, no such luck.  Fortunately it was well enough compacted that very little came loose to hum through my fenders.</p>
<p>Eventually the fresh chip seal ended and I settled down into cycling on the older, more mature chip seal.</p>
<p>Somewhere along this stretch my front water bottle, space bar, lights assembly started to deconstruct.  This entire contraption was the very epitome of a Rube Goldberg-esque experiment that had somehow escaped from the laboratory.  I stopped and stuffed the various parts into the Carradice.  Probably best that the season was over.  I could re-work this set-up next year.  And, hopefully I would finish this ride in daylight.</p>
<p>At Port Hadlock the control was a QFC supermarket.  I had a bagel with cream cheese and pesto, and some orange juice.  I would have lingered longer but figured I had gotten my "break" at the accident, so I hit the road again, bound for Port Ludlow.  There was lots more chip seal, and lots of ups and downs, before finally reaching the Hood Canal bridge.</p>
<p>On the bridge there was a car tire taking up the entire shoulder.  I stopped and set it aside.  There was lots of traffic so when I reached the infamous metal joint, I stopped and walked the bike over it.  This joint has no doubt downed many an absent-minded cyclist.</p>
<p>The route turned south on Highway 3.  Traffic was bumper to bumper and moving very fast.  It was a relief to get off this race track and onto Big Valley Road.  This time it was day light and I was able to see the camels.</p>
<p>Going through Poulsbo I checked the clock and realized that if I pushed it I could still break 70 hours.  So Š I did!  I found an ample reserve of power and pushed hard on the hills, sprinting up hill, on two occasions, to make orange lights.</p>  
<p>About a mile before the finish a car in the on-coming lane tooted its horn ­ it was John, being driven back to Port Orchard by his wife.  I waved a wave of happiness Š and relief!</p>
<p>Finally I arrived in Winslow.  Terry greeted me at the room (Island Country Inn).  He chatted briefly, then said he was headed home, after his long ordeal of supporting the entire 1000 km, and that the room was all mine.  I said I'd probably depart soon, bound for the ferry.  After munching a bit I checked out and headed for the ferry terminal, ahead of most of the cars.  That always feels good.</p>
<p>I probably got on an earlier ferry than Terry because there was a huge line of ferry traffic sitting on Highway 305.  The ferry arrived within minutes; timing is everything.</p>
<p>After the short crossing I headed out into the night life along 1st Avenue in downtown Seattle.  I had been dreading what I expected to be a long ride home, from the ferry terminal.  But the ride went very fast as I found that I had loads of extra energy!</p>

<p>It was 2:30am Saturday when we pulled off the street in front of the park. I immediately recognized faces, bikes, and of course couldn¹t miss Joe with his cool home-made recumbent. As I geared up for the start of the race, I visited with some of the other riders that I only see once a year at Cannonball. A little smack talk took place, but nothing bad. Mostly for humor. Riders were busy making last minute checks on their bikes and equipment. I originally was going to ride my full suspension mountain bike unsupported, figuring that Cannonball would be a perfect training ride for a big mountain bike race I was doing later on, and it was an appealing idea to not take the race so seriously. But, my good friend Paul Binford convinced me that if I rode my Trek-Y-Foil, supported, I might have a chance to win.
<p>Rumor had it that Jan Heine was not racing this year, and Allen, last year¹s co-winner with Jan, was nowhere in sight. But eventually Jan rolled in on his bike looking thin and intimidating, ready to race. Shortly after Jan, Allen showed up. This year Allen won Race across Oregon, a feat which qualified him for RAAM.
<p>Duane Wright announced that it was just minutes before the start, and gave us a quick briefing about road construction to look out for and the route, etc. There was a ten second countdown, and we were off. I always love shooting through the I90 Bike Tunnel at the start of Cannonball. Halfway down the tunnel we passed a homeless cyclist who was sleeping in a makeshift home with his bike tucked in close. He paid no attention to our madness. At the end of the tunnel I tried to pass Joe on the inside corner, but he gave me a sharp tongue lashing. I quickly apologized and watched him disappear across the bridge in his red canoe-shaped recumbent. I thought, ŒI must not try to catch Joe right now. I¹ll just have to catch him on the hills.¹ My body was pumped with adrenaline, so I felt great, and it was too dark to see my heart monitor. Being the techno-weenie that I am, I couldn¹t stop thinking that a heads-up display inside night vision glasses would be really cool. I just hoped I wasn¹t building up too much lactic acid in my legs.

<p><img align=left border=0 src="200-02.jpg">
We flew down the dark bike path across Mercer Island and when the trail ended at Factoria I was glad there were no pedestrian casualties in our wake. We then met our first hill, and as we climbed silently I realized there were four of us out front. Jan, Allen, Steve and myself. On the next climb to Newport there was some small talk and introductions. We then glided through intersections towards Issaquah. Once on I-90 I was finally able to settled down into a rhythm. I knew I had to avoid pulling too much. Otherwise, I wouldn¹t be fresh for the Snoqualmie climb. I was surprised to see Allen hanging back. I wasn¹t sure what he was up to. I found out later he was getting over a cold and wasn¹t feeling well. We had just crested Highpoint when Allen moved to the front to pull hard down the first descent, but he had trouble with his light rotating down whenever he hit a bump. He slowed down, because he was unable to see well. I lit the way for both of us with my new H.I.D. light that puts out 30 watts for four hours. My handy H.I.D. was so bright, in fact, that Jan complained that his eyes couldn¹t adjust to the brightness. 
<p>We rolled past North Bend and started the next climb. I wasn¹t quite sure when Allen fell behind, but about 5 miles before Snoqualmie Pass I noticed that he was no longer with us. At this point Jan asked me what my plan was, what finishing time was I shooting for?  I just said I was going to finish when the fat lady sings. I think that might have been the first time I ever made Jan laugh. He hung back a bit and asked Steve the same questions. I couldn¹t hear Steve¹s response, but had to chuckle a little as I watched Jan start strategizing for victory. He was trying to measure our strength. 
<p>Just a mile or so before the Snoqualmie climb, I dropped back, so I could rest, and Jan tried to whisper something to me. I slowed up to hear what he was trying to say, and noticed Steve looking back, with a concerned expression, wondering intently what Jan and I were discussing. I couldn¹t really hear what Jan was trying to tell me, but knew he hatching a plot to drop Steve. I wasn¹t really interested, so I just nodded and continued riding. Even though Steve was riding strong, I knew Jan and I would leave him behind on the next climb, regardless of any strategy.
<p>The moment came for the next climb. I took a shot of Gu and a big gulp from my Camelback, looked down at my heart monitor and pushed it up to 180. Sure enough, Steve fell back with Jan, and soon Jan¹s strategy became clear. He intended to move in front of Steve, slow down and force Steve to do the same, giving me a big lead. Then he would sprint away from Steve and regain me. Even though I did not agree to this move, I slowed up for Jan. Half way up the climb Jan and I were back together. 
<p>The biggest reason I waited for Jan was the fear of being run down, only to have Jan¹s wicked pen write another article like last year¹s. I also didn¹t have enough experience or confidence to try and break away from him. Earlier in the ride Jan had mentioned to Steve that it was unwise to piss him off, then asked me, somewhat ominously, to confirm the truth of his remark. He was obviously referring to last year¹s Cannonball when Paul and I were on the tandem and we refused to pull him. 
<p>Part of my insecurity was due to the fact that I had never ridden a successful ride at this distance and pace without some injury slowing me down. Lately I¹d been bothered by a small muscle on my hip. I guess all this left me susceptible to Jan¹s next move. The implicit Œgentleman¹s agreement¹ between us was that we would stick together for the rest of the race. Jan convinced me we would make better time working together and therefore secure a lead on Steve and Allen. Of course, this would mean that I would have to stop with Jan on his unsupported stops for food and water. 
<p>Together we crested Snoqualmie and I got a warm welcome from my wife, Janet, and Paul, my support crew. They asked if I needed anything, and I said Œno¹. Moments later Jan rolled up and informed me it was my turn to hammer the descent, so he could rest after all the maneuvering against Steve. I didn¹t mind pulling. I was feeling strong. This is definitely my favorite part of the race. A great tail wind always pushes you past Ellensburg. Of course, I was feeling great. I was leading Cannonball and leading Jan. 
<p>This was a first in my book, and I was having a good day. It didn¹t take long for reality to set in. I could hear my mentor, Paul¹s voice, "Use the force, Andy". OK ­ I remembered Paul telling me over and over again to only do my share of the pulling. At this point in the race I had taken off my light, arm warmers, leg warmers and the rest as the temperature was rising. The skies were already very blue. It was a bright sunny day. I was really enjoying the ride and my nervous butterflies were behind me. Not much was said between Jan and I as we shared pulls, but when his bike would miss-shift I taunted him that he should buy Shimano Durace. 
<p>Soon after rolling past Ellensburg we could see Paul on his bike up ahead ready to ride. He planned to ride part of the course to break up the monotony of driving. Unfortunately, when we finally caught up with Paul, Jan was concerned that people might think we were cheating. The idea of cheating didn¹t even occur to me and I don¹t think it would have mattered to most of the other riders who know Paul and I very well, and know that we wouldn¹t cheat. But to accommodate Jan, Paul rode a fair distance behind us.  
<p>We then started our ascent up to Rye Grass. It was hot, barren, and not very exciting. It felt good to crest at the top, tuck into an arrow position and to coast a bit with the occasional side winds cooling our faces. Halfway down I rolled behind Jan to let him take some of the pull. I noticed I was able to coast as fast as Jan was pedaling down the hill. I couldn¹t pass up the opportunity to point this out to him, emphasizing the benefits of my aerodynamic wheels and sleek carbon fiber frame. Jan immediately rejected the notion of my bike¹s technical superiority and simply noted that I weighed more. "I guess that¹s what was giving me an advantage on the climb," I told him. 
<p>By the time I reached the bridge I was actually relieved that we were no longer descending. Fighting the cross winds and keeping a sharp eye out for obstacles always makes the body tense up. As we climbed up out of the Gorge we could feel the refreshing spray of the waterfall there. I noticed a burn mark on the road from a car fire and my imagination went wild. I could just see a car ignite from the pure heat of the sun beating down on the rock cliffs and pavement. I looked back in the mirror and saw Paul riding very comfortably and indifferently, and I knew he was not impressed with our speed. As always, towards the top of the climb I looked for the sculpture of horses on the hillside, just the kind of pleasing scenery that serves to take my mind off the climb. 
<p>Once we were over the hill and headed for Moses Lake, I knew the rest of the race was going to be a long grueling stretch. Paul was back riding in the support vehicle, and Jan and I were approaching his first unsupported stop just before Moses Lake. Jan rolled up and reminded me that we needed to stop so he could re-fuel at the store. When Jan was in the store replenishing his supplies, I went to talk with my support crew. My wife, Janet, was not pleased. She asked me why I was stopping and reminded me that she and Paul didn¹t give up their entire day to support me across the state so that I could give the race to Jan. I explained the deal that Jan and I would ride together and make better time. Paul pointed out the fact that I was not riding as fast as I normally did in our recent training rides, and he wondered why I was holding back. I had mixed feelings. I realized I could not explain why I chose to team up with Jan, and quite honestly, was a little scared of the idea of breaking away from him. Could I really stay ahead of him all the way to the finish? I was afraid of injuries too. The thought of riding to the end with Jan was a comfortable temptation. 
<p>Then Janet made an interesting argument. If I finished with Jan, he would technically win because on paper he was Œunsupported¹, and I would have sacrificed my natural advantage as a supported rider by stopping at all his Œunsupported¹ refueling stops. At this point, I remembered an article that Jan once wrote in which he characterized support vehicles as being Œfrivolous¹. This ignited my competitive spirit. Soon Jan and I were back on the road together, but I was already plotting when to make my break-away move. 
<p>Normally on the Cannonball race you make your moves on the climbs, but those opportunities were long gone. We had less than 100 miles to go. Jan, the human camel, was refueled, and for the past 30 miles we hadn¹t been pushing very hard. I knew it was going to be difficult. Jan had mentioned he was going to make one more stop about 20 miles before the finish. I decided that I would continue to ride while he stopped for water, which would give me a 5 minute lead. I asked Jan if he would agree to alter our arrangement: if one of us was starting to fall behind, I said, the other could pull away. Jan agreed confidently, knowing that this would probably not happen. 
<p>I started riding very aggressively and pulled as hard as I could. I noticed that Jan¹s pulls were starting to slow up. I thought he might be saving himself, but it didn¹t stop me from being very aggressive on my pulls. I noticed Jan started showing signs of fatigue, shaking out his hands and sitting up to stretch out his lower back, so I decided to make a strategic suggestion. I asked Jan if we could pick up the pace because I wanted to make a 13:xx hour finish. Jan kind of laughed and said there was no way we could make it in under 14 hours. Knowing that it would trigger his strong competitive nature, I asked Jan if he would Œdig deep¹ and pull faster. Jan immediately picked up the pace. Whenever he fell below a certain speed, I would move to the front and pull as hard as I could. I could see signs of fatigue on his face in my mirror, so I didn¹t let up. I kept reminding him that I¹d like to get the fastest time we could. 
<p>Fifty miles before the end of the race I made my definitive move. Jan was a little wobbly on his bike, so I decided to let him do one more pull to the base of a large roller, then I¹d try to leave him on the climb. I was just hoping Jan wasn¹t playing possum and waiting for me to humiliate myself. Up the hill, I hammered down on the pedals, but I didn¹t stand, because I didn¹t want it to be obvious what I was doing. At the top of the hill I could see my support vehicle. As I went by I told Paul to stay close, in case I got a flat. I could see the excitement on Paul¹s and Janet¹s faces. I think they were very surprised that I was making a break. Jan started falling behind. Now I felt confident. I felt strong. I knew I could keep up that pace until the finish. 
<p>Once Jan was out of sight the enthusiasm of my support team went through the roof. My wife Janet was no longer a loyal but sleepy spectator. Now, she was a nuclear-powered cheering squad. Paul anxiously monitored Jan¹s position, hanging way back, at times, to make sure I still had a significant lead. I¹m glad I was able to pull away from Jan before he had to stop for water, even though I knew Jan would not be happy about it.  I was excited too. What a feeling to be the leader in the Cannonball race. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. 
<p>The last 10 miles of the race I was pushing as hard as I could. I wasn¹t worried about the heat and was surprised that I was finishing strong with no aches and pains. The last 2 miles I started to wonder where my support vehicle was. As I pulled off the freeway and rolled over the overpass, I glanced down to see if I could spot the support vehicle, then pressed on to the finish line. The Starlight parking lot was empty. I rolled in feeling a keen sense of amazement. I had actually won. I had the hotel management sign a paper with my finish time on it ­ 4:56pm ­ for a total of 13 hours 56 minutes. Five minutes later Janet and Paul rolled in. Paul had underestimated the distance to the finish. Twenty-two minutes after I came in, Jan showed up. He was not pleased. He felt I¹d broken a sacred pact, but I¹d rather live with Jan¹s wrath than Janet¹s, and I would have endured anyone¹s wrath in exchange for the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction I felt at that moment.

<h2>The SIR Autumn 200 km</h2>

<p>What began last year as an experiment to extend the brevet season has become a successful reality.  Again this season SIR offered a September 200 km brevet to introduce cyclists to randonneuring.  Several new riders along with a core members enjoyed a beautiful day of cycling the Snoqualmie Valley, Burn Road and roads between.</p>
<p>The peleton broke from its Audux style riding early on the way to Issaquah and regrouped at the first control.  This pattern was to repeat itself throughout the ride.  With a group of riders having varing abilities, this was natual.</p>
<p>My most memorable part of the ride: Riding at the back of a pace line of six riders wearing our club's jersey.</p>
<p>After the ride, Mark treated us to a barbeque dinner.  Thanks, Mark!</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that Mark completed all 2001 SIR brevets: 200 km, 300 km, 400 km, 600 km, 1000 km & 200 km.</p>
