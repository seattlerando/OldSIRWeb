<b>Ride:</b> Issaquah Alps 100 km UnPopulaire<br>
<b>Organizers:</b> <a href="mailto:heine@mindspring.com">Jan Heine</a> / <a href="mailto:peterson@halcyon.com">Kent Peterson</a><br>
<b>Date:</b> Saturday, September 21, 2002<br>
<b>Time:</b> Start Time: 8:45 a.m. (Please arrive by 8:30 for registration)<br>
<b>Start Location:</b> Issaquah Park and Ride Parking Lot<br>
<b>Address:</b> Corner of SR-900 and
Newport Way, Issaquah<br>
<b>Entry Fee:</b> None.
<p>
<b>Notes:</b> The ride will be run as a mini-brevet, complete with control cards. Some of
the controls are "informational" which means you'll have to write down an answer to some simple question. Bring a pen and a watch to record your answers and your time.
<p>
<b>Time Limit:</b> All riders should finish the ride within 6 hours 40 minutes.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> A very hilly 110 kilometer ride including Cougar Mountain, Tiger
Mountain, the Issaquah Plateau and Squak Mountain. The 2002 version of this ride is
actually a bit hillier than the 2001 version was. In addition to the always popular 900 foot climb up Zoo Hill that hits 2 kilometers into the ride, Jan has figured out a way to route riders down and up Cougar Mountain a second time. After that we'll work our way along the May Valley, past the scenic horse farms on the Jones Road, up the Cedar Grove Road and then have a lovely climb up Tiger Mountain. We'll roll back through Issaquah and then climb the Plateau via the Black Nugget
Road. BTW, blame Alex Taylor for this bit of routing. The road does have a sidewalk alongside it for the climb, but the climb is somehow both steeper and longer than last year's plateau route. We'll follow the Issaquah-Fall City Road to the Snoqualmie River Valley were we enjoy a rare bit of flat riding up to Carnation.
<p>
After the control stop at Sandy's Espresso, we climb over Tolt hill and before climbing back up the Plateau on Duthie Hill Road. Then it's back into the busy streets of Issaquah before the final quad-busting climb up Mountain Park Boulevard. Just before you black out from oxygen debt, note that the cross streets on Mountain Park Boulevard are named after famous mountains. Mount Everest
Drive is only about halfway up, so you have to keep going.
<p>
Sherpas will not be provided.
