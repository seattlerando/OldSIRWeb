If you are planning on doing the 600 km please send an email to: <A HREF="mailto:PeterTwo@SeattleInsuranceAgency.com">Peter Beeson</A> and let him know. We are trying to get a rough estimate of participants for the brevet so that we can plan for hotel rooms and "overnight" baggage transport. (If you are thinking of spending the night in Kingston you can visit <a href="http://www.kingstonwa.com/" target="_blank">this site for info on lodging options</a>).

<b>Special Instruction:</b>
<p>
<A HREF="600km_1_2006Notes.html"><B>2006 Pre-ride Notes</B></A>
<p>
Reach the ferry terminal in Edmonds in time to catch the 5:50 a.m. ferry in order to make it to the start on time. Ferry schedule and information: <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ed-king" target="_blank">http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ed-king</a>.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are a must or you'll face the scorn and abuse of your fellow randonneurs. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Kingston Ferry Terminal, commuter lot on right at Ohio St. (one block up from ferry landing on right)
<p>
<b>Bag Drop:</b> There will be one bag drop in Aberdeen only at the overnight. Make sure the organizer has your <I>small</I> bag at the start (Small means you can carry it with you while riding). Bag drop bags will not be back to Kingston before 1:00 p.m.
<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Drifter Galley in Kingston on right open for food from 07:30 to 21:00, SIR manned afterwards.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> Same route from 2003. We will make a complete circuit of the Olympic Peninsula. From the start in Kingston, we'll head across the Hood Canal Bridge and follow SR-104 and US-101 to Port Angeles. From there we'll take the Strait of Juan de Fuca Highway (SR-112) to Clallam Bay and then south on SR-113 back to US-101. The route passes through Forks, Kalaloch, and Quinault Lodge on the way to the overnight stop in Aberdeen. From Aberdeen we go east on US-12 and back roads (SR-107 and SR-108) to McCleary and Kamilche, where the route picks up US-101 N again. Head up the west side of the Hood Canal back to the bridge and the finish at Kingston at the Drifter Galley restaurant.
