<b>Randonneuring Tip Sheet</b>
<p>
This page was originally established to provide new Randonneurs
with a source of information about our sport.&nbsp; It has developed into
collection of experiences and recommendations ranging from an explanation
of terms to what works and what to avoid.&nbsp; Some of the more valuable
items are the personal testimonials that may enrich another's knowledge.&nbsp;
This was written by Pete Bajema.
<p>
If some of this information sounds contradictory it only
reflects the differing experiences of the contributing Randonneurs.
<p>
<b>Randonneuring</b> - a style of cycling in one or more events
called brevets.&nbsp; Brevets conform to a set of guidelines defined by
Audax Club Parisien (ACP) in France and amended for Americans by Randonneurs USA
{RUSA} in Middleton RI,&nbsp; and&nbsp; International
Randonneurs {IR} in Syracuse, NY.
<p>
<b>Brevets</b> - are formal events that are something
in-between a race and a tour.&nbsp; They are usually run as a series, each
brevet graduates in distance from the previous starting at 200 kilometers
(Km) up to 1200 Km.&nbsp; Each brevet has a specific time limit to finish
in that is based on the overall distance.&nbsp; The minimum average speed
to successfully complete a brevet is just under 10 mph.&nbsp; A detailed
set of route navigating instructions (Que. sheet) is provided by the brevet
organizer along with a passport or control card that must be validated
at specified points (controls or check points) along the way and defined
on the Que. sheet.&nbsp; The organizer may also set one or more hidden
or secret controls to further insure compliance to the defined route.&nbsp;
Support is not allowed between official controls.&nbsp; Traditionally,
brevets are training and qualifying for entry in the Paris Brest Paris
(PBP) event but not exclusive to this end, especially in non qualifying
years.&nbsp; Brevets also test the reliability and effectiveness of your
equipment and preparation.
<p>
A typical scenario might be: after the start you ride
in a group to the first control (an AM/PM station.) Jump off the
bike and dash inside to get your control card time stamped and signed.&nbsp;
Find the toilet, buy enough food and drink to get you to the next control.&nbsp;
Jump back on your bike and catch up with your group that left you behind
for being poky.&nbsp; A few variations might be: taking a short nap, have
breakfast with your buddy, sit staring into space until the next bunch
comes through, and dancing around a source of heat trying to get feeling
into your shivering body.
<p>
This summary of a brevet may sound like all work and no
play, but there is something special about the challenge of randonneuring
that makes the struggle worthwhile. Certainly, the challenge and sense
of satisfaction of riding long distance unsupported puts each of us in
close touch with ourselves.&nbsp; But the best thing that you will get
out of randonneuring is the camaraderie of joining in the challenge with
like-minded cyclists, of receiving a word of encouragement from a fellow
rider who knows exactly what you are feeling and of being able to offer
the same type of encouragement to other riders.
<p>
<b>Randonneurs</b> - have been categorized as "Super Tourists."
<p>
<b>Nutrition</b> - fuel for the body is not discussed
because of the complexity of what we like to or don't consume.&nbsp; It's
just too personal a subject to generalize.&nbsp; A phrase worth remembering
is "Eat before you're hungry, drink before you're thirsty."&nbsp; Let it
be said that you can't get too many calories on a rondonnee and you usually
don't.
<p>
<b>Bicycle</b> - There is prevalent today an urge to go for the lightest
weight possible - often at the expense of durability.&nbsp; There is nothing
wrong with light weight bikes and components, but in choosing components
be careful.&nbsp; During a brevet, you are not permitted to receive assistance
outside of controls.&nbsp; Randonneuring can be hard on your bicycle.&nbsp;
If a lightweight component breaks during a ride, it may signal the end
of your day.
<p>
Give yourself every advantage, go for comfort.&nbsp; After
40 or 80 hours of riding you'll never regret it.
<p>
<b>Frame</b> - fits your body size and is properly setup for
comfort.&nbsp; Carbon fiber is an excellent shock deadening material. The Softride beam bikes are a marvelous invention for
the long distance traveler.&nbsp; The bouncing beam does it's job to absorb
road shock but does take a while to adjust to.
<p>
<b>Wheels</b> - rims, spokes and tires.&nbsp; A set of high quality
wheels built for comfort and durability is one of your best investments.&nbsp;
Large profile tires (23 c minimum 25 -28 c are better) preferably with
soft sidewalls give a more comfortable ride, reducing the numbing effects
of road vibration.&nbsp; With the larger tires 100 lbs of air pressure
is sufficient to protect from pinch puncture and affords a luxurious ride.&nbsp;
It's pure fallacy that ultra hi-pressure reduces rolling resistance.&nbsp;
Mr. Tuffy tire inserts do work especially against glass punctures but add
weight at the very worst place.&nbsp; You must still inspect your tires
periodically for cuts and imbedded debris.&nbsp; Three cross spoke built
wheels are a standard.&nbsp; Radial pattern is for the macho.&nbsp; Mavic
makes a rim with ceramic braking surface.&nbsp; It's worth it's price in
the safety it provides in wet conditions.&nbsp; Tip: you only need the
front since that's where most of the stopping power is.&nbsp; Checking
your tire pressure before each ride will help prevent pinch flats.
<p>
<b>Seat</b> - very personal.&nbsp; Hopefully it includes some
shock absorbing characteristics... i.e. rubber mounted rails.
<p>
<b>Handle bars</b> - should afford a variety of hand positions
to reduce fatigue.&nbsp; The anatomic style 6 or 8 bend work well.
<p>
<b>Handle Bar tape</b> - the purpose of handle bar tape is twofold.&nbsp;
It affords a degree of padding and provides a tactile gripping surface.&nbsp;
Cinelli Cork tape does both exceedingly well.&nbsp; Some thing you don't
want is your hand slipping off the drop when you're zoned-out at 2 am.
<p>
<b>Tri-bars</b> - are legal in the US but discouraged, they are
<b>illegal</b> on PBP.&nbsp; They do offer some relief from pressure on the hands
and allow for&nbsp; an more aerodynamic body position.&nbsp; The controversy
is that they are dangerous when used in a pack or pace line.&nbsp; Always
use extreme care riding a pace line especially when with unfamiliar riders.
<p>
<b>STI/Ergo shifters </b> - very desirable.&nbsp; Chances are
you'll shift into the proper gear if you don't have a long reach to do
it, especially when your energy is most precious.&nbsp; Being able to shift
while standing is another nice feature.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p>
<b>Lighting </b> - What kind of lighting to choose for randonneuring
is the most frequently discussed question among Randonneurs.&nbsp; There
is no one clear answer.&nbsp; The high end systems like Night Sun and Night
Rider with water bottle batteries provide a flood of light and are terrific
for commuting, but the batteries do not last longer than 4-5 hours (at
most) without recharging.&nbsp; Many riders have had good experience running
a pair of Cateye halogen&nbsp; lights running off of D Cells or AA batteries.&nbsp;
Others supplement a handlebar mounted battery with a lightweight headlamp
like those made by Petzel (which can be especially useful when changing
a flat tire or repairing one's machine at night).&nbsp; Regardless of what
you choose for your primary lighting, ride with a back-up light, both front
and rear.&nbsp; In the back, Vista lights and their offspring work well,
offer good visibility and&nbsp; are dependable.&nbsp; Choose a version
that allows a steady mode as well as a flashing option.&nbsp; Flashing
rear lights are not permitted in France and your fellow riders will thank
you if they do not have to ride behind to the annoyance of a flashing strobe.&nbsp;
Again, be sure to bring extra batteries and if possible and extra bulb.   
<p>
<b>Headlamp</b>: D cells rule.&nbsp; Four in a box give you nearly
6 volts that will get you through the night and with a 5 watt bulb produces
an adequate beam.&nbsp; D cells are the most readily available and are
used internationally.&nbsp; The Cateye Hyper Halogen ($25) can be easily
modified with a short piece of lamp wire to use an auxiliary&nbsp; 4 D
cell battery pack (Radio Shack $2.)&nbsp; At least one extra bulb must
be carried.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rear: more is better, you want to be visible.&nbsp;
In Europe flashing lights are illegal, make sure you can switch the strobe
into a steady glow if you go.   
<p>
<b>Fenders</b> - a must in the northwest.&nbsp; Remember, they
are not meant to protect you as much as those behind you.&nbsp; Novel concept.&nbsp;
Don't forget the flap extension, this is where the real protection come
from.&nbsp; Attached with a plastic zip tie.&nbsp; One gallon plastic milk
containers are a good source for extension material.   
<p>
<b>Pump</b> - if you carry one make sure it works.&nbsp; Most
of the mini-pumps are useless.&nbsp; The Zefal HPX is fast and is capable
of blowing the tire off the rim.   
<p>
Silca frame pumps can be a nuisance because they do not
lock on the valve.&nbsp; Blackburn frame pumps not only lock on the valves
to provide a secure fit, but they also have a pivoting handle to provide
more comfort and leverage when pumping.&nbsp; When you're tired and get
a puncture, you want to make getting back on the road as easy as possible.   
<p>
<b>Pedals</b> - SPD style allow safe and comfortable walking.&nbsp;
Randonneurs spend more time than we admit to off the bike schlepping about.&nbsp;
Cleat/pedal float is a personal preference.   
<p>
SPD pedals are fine for many riders but some complain
of hot spots during long rides due to the small platform of the pedal.&nbsp;
If&nbsp; you use SPD's, make sure that your shoe has a very stiff sole.&nbsp;
Knee problems can also arise during a long ride, if your pedals do not
have sufficient float.&nbsp; Time pedals offer a large platform for comfort
and also feature lots of float.&nbsp; The cleats do wear out while walking,
and you will have to replace them more frequently than you will with SPD's.&nbsp; Always check your cleats before an important ride.   
<p>
<b>Bottle cages</b> - 2 is the minimum, more is better unless
you like carrying 7 lbs on your back.   
<p>
<b>Gearing</b> - a 39 X 24 low is a reasonable minimum in the
NW.&nbsp; A triple is swell.   
<p>
<b>Computer </b> - which ever one you use make sure it's reliable
and accurately calibrated to the wheel you're riding.&nbsp; Change the
batteries before they fail.&nbsp; Don't forget to re-calibrate if you change
the tire size i.e. use your folding spare and it's a different size.   
<p>
<b>Bags</b> - a handlebar bag keeps stuff (food, camera, ointments,
face towel, etc.) reachable.&nbsp; A good rule of thumb is to distribute
additional serious weight evenly between front and back (balance, something
we should strive for in life).&nbsp; If you use a rear mounted rack the
tendency is to overload it which effects the bicycle's balance and can
make handling dangerous.&nbsp; Move some weight up-front.&nbsp; Lower (low
riders) is better but compromises accessibility while riding. 
<p>
Front handlebar bags are particularly useful if they
feature a map window to place your route map.&nbsp; If you do not use a
handlebar bag, consider using a map holder that attaches to your handlebar.   
<p>
Some riders find that handlebar bags affect handling and
also obstruct headlights.&nbsp; If you are not carrying too much weight,
some riders use a rack trunk and a rear rack. Also, some manufacturers
make large capacity seat bags, which can be combined with a small fanny
back to haul your gear (if you aren't prone to back problems).   
<p>
<b>Reflective tape</b> - put it every where, you want to be seen.   
<p>
<b>Clothing</b> 
<p>
Your clothing must protect you from a range of weather
between wet and cold when descending a mountain pass in the rain with a
wind chill factor of below freezing to the hot and dry of eastern Washington
in July/August, 100+ degree heat.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you must carry
what you use and if you don't have it you can't use it.&nbsp; Versatility
is key as is compactness and light weight.&nbsp; With experience comes
refinements in your cycling software.&nbsp; Multiple light layers work
better than a single heavy one.&nbsp; They give you more flexibly in adjusting
to the prevailing conditions.   
<p>
A good combination for a "normal" ride might be, in addition
to a short sleeve jersey and shorts, leg warmers, a long-sleeve wicking
undershirt or long-sleeve jersey, rain shell, arm warmers, light-weight
long-fingered gloves and a reflective vest.&nbsp; Sometimes, it can feel
like a nuisance to carry this much stuff, but if it starts to rain, gets
cool and gets late in the day, you will be glad you brought it along.   
<p>
<b>Helmet</b> - is required.&nbsp; Reflective tape is advisable
for night rides.   
<p>
Reflective garment (vest) - must be worn after sunset.&nbsp;
The purpose is safety, too be seen at night.&nbsp; The large reflective
triangle commonly used is very effective but not a substitute for a vest.&nbsp;
Reflective ankle bands are very effective due to foot movement. I would emphasize that a reflective vest is <b>mandatory</b>.   
<p>
<b>Eye protection </b> - is suggested for both day and night conditions.   
<p>
<b>Rain jacket</b> - A high quality jacket is indispensable and
also serves as windbreaker.&nbsp; Burley makes a great one for under $100.   
<p>
<b>Shorts </b> - bibs are wonderful, their comfort far out weigh
any inconvenience.&nbsp; Choice of chamois is as personal as food, funny
how that works.   
<p>
<b>Tights or leg warmers</b> - necessary, especially at night. HIND makes a tight called DriLete that are the warmest I've used in cool wet weather.   
<p>
<b>Balaclava/Skull cap</b> - handy for napping out of doors,
genius in the extreme cold.&nbsp; We lose 80% of our body heat from our
head.&nbsp; Although a butt warmer may serve a few better.   
<p>
<b>Booties</b> - recommend&nbsp; in cool rainy conditions.&nbsp;
They provide a degree of warm comfort and help prevent Achilles tendon
injuries. Some don't agree that booties are a necessity.&nbsp;
They are nice to start off with on an early spring ride or if it's raining
when the ride start, but they are a pain to carry.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also prefer
lightweight socks of polypro or similar material - they do not bunch up
or create painful spots when riding - again a matter of personal preference.   
<p>
<b>Socks</b> - wool is warm when wet and cool in the heat.   
<p>
<b>Long and short fingered gloves</b> - good palm padding is
desirable but not so much that your hands will be uncomfortable or cramp
when clinched.   
<p>
<b>Other</b> - I carry a small damp face towel, it's handy for wiping
a sweaty face while riding and nothing refreshes better on a hot day than
a cool cleanup at a control.   
<p>
<b>Body</b> 
<p>
Needless to say a sound mind and body are requisite for
randonneuring with an emphasis on the former.&nbsp; The graduated brevet
series will whip you into shape physically but there is no quick fix for
the psyche.&nbsp; We are a product of our life's experiences, for better
or worse. If you subscribe to zenism then a mantra may get you
through a difficult section, it will at least detach you from the struggle.&nbsp;
My favorite is "either I've done tougher or I'm&nbsp; setting a new personal
record."&nbsp; Riding with a partner is probably the best, working together
as a team, sharing the highs and helping each other through the lows.   
<p>
<b>First Aid Kit</b> 
<p>
This is the most important article we don't carry.&nbsp;
At a minimum it should contain sun block, anti-inflammation/pain pills,
various size Band-Aids and gauze pads, tube of antiseptic cream, antiseptic
wipes, triangular bandage (many uses, most common to immobilize a dislocated
shoulder) and a card with any personal medical alert information (if any)
and an emergency contact w/phone no. and address.   
<p>
<b>Extras</b> 
<p>
Space blanket - is one of the more important items you
hope never to use.&nbsp; They are light and compact. Can be used as a shelter
in hot or cold conditions or cut to fit under your clothing in an extreme
emergency.   
<p>
Small light - One that can be held in your teeth (leaving
hands free) to assist in night repairs or reading the Que. sheet   
<p>
Spare tire - (folding type) and 3 tubes.   
<p>
Spokes - extra for front wheel and both sides (which are
different lengths) of rear wheel.   
<p>
Lots of riders use compact tools.&nbsp; Generally, I find
that a set of the Allen wrenches that fit the Allen screws on your bike,
a small screw driver, spoke wrench and small penknife work better and are
not that inconvenient to carry along..&nbsp; Compact all in one tools often
compromise on performance for the sake of convenience.&nbsp; If you insist
on one of these types of tools, though, I think that the kool tool is the
best.   
<p>
Knife - the tiny Swiss Army classic is a monster tool
with ultra sharp knife blade and scissors.&nbsp; Tooth pick and tweezers
included.   
<p>
Tape - hunk of electricians (black plastic) or duct tape.&nbsp;
Handy for emergency repairs   
<p>
Mobile phone - can be a life saver if not a convenience.&nbsp;
The best use I've seen is calling in an order for pizza while on route.   
<p>
Energy gel - very handy for a short duration picker upper.&nbsp;
Carry lots.   
<p>
An alligator type clip zip tied to your handle bar stem
makes a convenient route sheet holder.   
<p>
Timex Iron Man Wrist watch has a useful continuous count
down timer feature.&nbsp; Set it to how often you want to eat or drink
and the alarm will remind you.   
<p>
Especially useful on PBP is a small helmet mounted light.&nbsp;
The route direction arrows are placed above the normal beam height of your
head lamp to deter pilfering.   
<p>
A shock mounted handle bar stem like the Girvin is effectively
deadens road vibration.&nbsp; It does take time adjusting to the free movement
when standing but it's a small inconvenience weighed against the comfort.   
<p>
Park Super (pre-glued) Patches make a fast and effective
tube repair.&nbsp; They don't work on wet tubes.   
<p>
Kevlar cord emergency spoke.&nbsp; Compact, one size fits
all, it really works.   
<p>
Chain tool - the Cyclo mini-tool compact, light and could
save your bacon. The Topeak's too &quot;the Alien&quot; is a 20 pc &quot;all in
one tool that is also highly recommended. 
<p>
<b>Things that fail</b> 
<p>
The Brain - usually the first to go is good judgment.&nbsp;
An endearing quality of virtually all Randonneurs is persistence.&nbsp;
When you are bumping along well into a brevet with little or no sleep,
it's difficult to make good decisions.&nbsp; It may be best to get off
the bike and rest but you don't realize that, you're zoned-out and running
on auto pilot.   
<p>
Tires and tubes - this is where the rubber meets the road
and bad things are expected to happen.&nbsp; Carry extras, you will use
them.&nbsp; On one brevet a rider had 9 flats.&nbsp; Not all were attributed
to road junk.&nbsp; It's always prudent to resolve the reason for flatting
or you'll be into Deja vu again.&nbsp; Avoid riding through a disintegrated
radial truck tires, the super fine steel wire is frustratingly difficult
to find when imbedded in your tire.   
<p>
Fork - a 15 year old steel front fork blade was within
a millimeter or two of catastrophic failure.&nbsp; Luckily the rider noticed
eccentric handling and got off before a crash, his brevet was over.&nbsp;
Regular frame inspection is advised.   
<p>
Spoke nipples - alloy spoke nipples are prone to failure.&nbsp;
In this case two failed nipples caused the wheel to collapse on route.&nbsp;
Persevering, the rider was able to get a complete wheel rebuild at a control
and finished the PBP.   
<p>
Chain Wheel - sparing no expense on hired gun maintenance
and best of show in equipment the large chain wheel bolts loosened stripping
the spider threads.&nbsp; Again perseverance and money were the solution
to replacing the crank assembly which allowed him to finish PBP.&nbsp;
An equipment check prior to the start may have detected the loose bolts.   
<p>
Cassette hub - it was the best money could buy.&nbsp;
The free wheel mechanism froze turning his machine into a fix gear.&nbsp;
Limping into a PBP control a new low tech wheel was purchased and he continued
on.&nbsp; The damaged cassette hub was abnormally noisy out of the box
and should have been suspect but the manufactures name was trusted, erroneously.   
<p>
Heat exhaustion - classic failure to slow the pace down
during the heat of the day.&nbsp; No serious harm, just many hours lost
while recovering in first aid.&nbsp; Again on PBP.   
<p>
Bearings - randonneuring is tremendously hard on headsets,
hubs, and bottom brackets.&nbsp; Check these for loss of grease&nbsp; frequently,
especially after rainy rides.&nbsp; One experienced randonneur neglected
to check his bottom bracket before PBP, had his bottom bracket seize during
the event and lost so much time getting it repaired that he finished outside
of the time limit.&nbsp; A sealed bottom bracket minimizes maintenance
but should still be checked periodically.&nbsp; Chris King headsets cost
more than their competitors but wear so much better that they are cheaper
in the long run..   
<p>
<b>Here is a randonneuring bike that works for me (John Wagner.)<br></b> 
<br>Talisman, custom made frame by Rob Collins (Seattle)
for a Softride beam (softest flex), Reynolds tube set, Time carbon fiber
fork.&nbsp; Geometry is equivalent to a conventional 56 cm sport frame,
wheel base 99 cm.&nbsp; The only thing I'd change is a few more centimeters
in the wheel base.   
<p>
Saddle - Selle Italia Titanium rail Turbomatic.   
<p>
Handle Bar (HB) - Modolo 8 bend with Cinelli cork tape.&nbsp;
Mavic stem.&nbsp; A Girvin flex stem is in the future.   
<p>
Group - Shimano Ultegra&nbsp; STI 8 speed.   
<p>
Gearing - front 53 X 39, rear 12 X 23 or 13 X 28, depending
on use.   
<p>
Wheels - 32 spoke, 3 cross, 15 gauge.&nbsp; Mavic Ceramic
(coated braking surface) rims provide superb braking in the rain.&nbsp;
Ripstop rim tape is light and doesn't melt in the heat.&nbsp; Mavic hubs
w/Sealed bearings are maintenance free and smooth running.   
<p>
Tires - Continental Super Sport Ultra folding 700 X 25
c.&nbsp; Inflated to 100 lbs. max.&nbsp; Kevlar bead is light weight where
it counts, flexible sidewalls give a luxurious ride but are damageable.   
<p>
Bottom bracket - Mavic sealed (no maintenance) bottom
bracket.   
<p>
Fenders - Full coverage front and rear.&nbsp; 6" flap
extension on rear (most important.)   
<p>
Pedals - Shimano dura-ace&nbsp; SPD.&nbsp; Used since
'92, maintenance free.&nbsp; MB type shoe with recessed cleat allows safe,
comfortable walking.   
<p>
Handle bar bag - Quix detachable.&nbsp; Small enough to
fit inside of Shimano STI cables, large enough to hold what I need close
at hand.   
<p>
Rear rack - Blackburn.&nbsp; Jandd&nbsp; trunk pack (well
fastened) holds spare folding tire, food, clothing and tools.&nbsp; An
extra bungy strap is handy in an emergency.   
<p>
Head light - Cat eye, similar performance as Hyper - hung
at the end of a L shape PVC bracket attached to HB to clear the HB bag.&nbsp;
Power by an auxiliary battery pack holding 4 D cells and spare bulb.   
<p>
Tail light - multiple vista lights.   
<p>
Bottle cages - Elite, hold well yet allow easy extraction.&nbsp;
Pros use them in Paris-Roubaix. On PBP we hit some cobble at speed at night and equipment went flying.&nbsp; My gear stayed on.
