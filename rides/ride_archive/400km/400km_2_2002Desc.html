<b>Special Instructions:</b>
<p>
<b> Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
<b>Ride Beginning:</b> Let Mark know if you need a place to stay the night before before the start.
<p>
<b>Ride End:</b> Mark Thomas residence. Post-ride nap space, food, and showers available (bring a towel).
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> The route is new for this year. >From near Redmond, the route will take back roads to Snohomish then follow Highway 9 to Arlington. From Arlington, the route will take Highway 530 to Darrington and then to Rockport. From there it will take you west to Sedro-Wooley on SR-20 and then on mostly back roads to Chuckanut Drive. A scenic stretch along the water will take you to the turnaround point in Fairhaven (Bellingham). The control will be at the Red Apple Market or any of the nearby restaurants or gas stations. The return trip will feature Bayview-Edison Road, La Conner, Conway, Stanwood, and Silvana on the way to Arlington. From Arlington, the route retraces its start back to Mark's house.
