<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Fixed gears - excerp from Kent
    Peterson<br>
    </strong></font>I rode the fixed gear Pinerello on the Salmon
    Cycle Route(with the same modifications as Friday's ride).
    This route has lots of climbs and descents and probably
    wouldn't be most people's choice for a fixed gear ride.I don't
    think I'm normal. I loved riding the fixed gear on this
    course. Yep there were parts where I wish I had a better spin
    and I hit a wicked headwind on the section from Carnation to
    Snoqualmie Falls but man, this is riding. The toughest thing
    was the long descent on I-90 coming back fromNorth Bend.
    Between High Point and Issaquah, something happened and I
    snapped the chain, I wasn't going super fast (maybe 40 KPH)
    but suddenly my chain was gone. By the time I stopped the
    bike (the only brake is on the front) I couldn't find any
    sign of the chain. But it was all downhill to Issaquah so I
    coasted (for the first time that day!) into Stephan's, bought
    a new chain and put it on. Now here's the thing: 25.7 KPH
    average. Yeah I wasn't as fast on the descents and it's a
    hilly, windy course but 25.7 KPH. I did 24 KPH a couple of
    days before on the recumbent and a few months ago Peter McKay
    and I rode the same course on our PBP bikes for a respectable
    25 KPH average. Hmm. I really do think I'm turning British
    sometimes. You know those cazy old guys we saw riding fixed
    gears on PBP? I think they're on to something.<br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>Now this guy is Definitely a cyclist!!!</strong></em>

    <a name="V4I9A3"></a><font size="3"><strong>Recap Of Annual
    SIR Meeting held on 10/16/99</strong></font><strong> </strong><br>
    The SIR Fall general meeting was held on October 16, 1999 at
    Hales Ales Pub in Ballard. Pizza, beer, good cheer, and PBP
    stories were shared by quite a few SIR members and a few
    potential members.<br>
    <br>
    During the meeting we finalized the 2000 brevet schedule,
    including selecting the brevet organizers. We added a 1000 km
    and a couple of fall brevets to the normal schedule. New
    officers were elected - Mark Thomas (RBA), Kent Peterson (Newsletter
    Editor), and Bill Dussler (Treasurer).<br>
    <br>
    Outgoing RBA Max Maxon handed out medals and brevet cards.
    1999 brevet volunteers were recognized and given a gift. Greg
    Cox briefed the group about the SIR / PBP sweatshirts that he
    is having made. In other business, we agreed not to change
    the name of the club and we discussed working more closely
    with the BC club.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks to Max and Bill for a great meeting. Thanks also to
    Max, Bill, and Pete for their service as club officers in
    1999. <br>

    <p><a name="V4I9A4"></a><strong>Jim Trout Runs the Seattle
    Marathon<br>
    </strong>I made it!!  I laughed, I cried, I hurt. 
    My endogenous endorphins were really kicking in over the last
    8 miles.  PAIN and more PAIN.  Wow and Ow. 
    The last 5 miles were filled with 12% grades and other
    winding, curving, endless hills.  I thought it would be
    a great site to come out of the woods and see the Space
    Needle (finish line).  Wrong.  Why did it still
    have to be 2.5 miles away?  It never looked so bloody
    far away in my entire life, like a million miles away,
    obviously there, beckoning me, but laughing at me all the
    while.  After the "survival shuffle" up a few
    more grades, I finally managed a halfway-decent gait the last
    1/4 mile to the cheering crowd at Memorial Stadium in Seattle
    Center.  I didn't collapse, I didn't puke, and I
    actually smiled as I crossed the finish line.  My friend
    Sangeeta greeted me at the finish and I asked if she had any
    spare morphine.  She said this was only the beginning. 
    Some ibuprofen and a nice, frothy cold beer did just the
    trick.  Mmmmm...<br>
    <br>
    The winner of the race (2:30:03) is a German grad student at
    UW, and he runs 90 (NINETY!!) miles per week with a high of
    145 miles one week.  Unbelievable!!!  Now that's
    what I call training.  I guess my 7 days/51 miles since
    Oct. 17 with nary a run since Nov. 6th can't really hold a
    candle to that.  I just don't understand how a person
    can go out and run 10 or more miles and expect to have any
    normal kind of day, scratch that, WEEK after the body is
    wrung through 10+ running miles.  I suppose daily
    activity is the key; the human body will adapt.  I
    couldn't believe the phrase "I'm NEVER doing this again!!"
    didn't pop out of my mouth at the finish, but rather "I
    could've trained harder and broken 3:30!!"  Jim ran
    the Marathon in 3:48:51. So, that will be my goal for the
    next marathon.  I just hope my aching feet and ankles
    can put up with the tolls of training.  We'll see!!!<br>
    <br>
    2nd Half Marathon Time = 2:03:38 (avg= 9:32 min/mile)<br>
    Total Marathon Time = 3:48:51 (avg = 8:44 min/mile)<br>

Welcome home and congratulations. While you were engaging in
international diplomacy I was gallivanting around our southwest but
that's another story. I did have the good fortune to stop in Montana
and visit with a legend in his own time, the irrepressible Ralph Awesome
Harris. He says hello to everyone and to come on over for a visit. Ralph
took me out for a 40 mile bicycle ride and later I join he and Betty for
their 22th wedding anniversary dinner. <b>Here are a few photos,<b> less
you've forgotten. Ralph and Betty can be reached at (406)961-5236 and

    Seattle PBP team together to swap stories and share pictures.
    I'd like to invite you (and long-suffering family members as
    well) to our house on Friday, September 17th at 6PM. Please
    let me know as soon as possible if you can attend and how
    many will be coming. Go get those pictures developed! <br>
    <br>
    Thanks, <br>
    Mark Thomas <br>

<a name="V4I8A5"></a><H3>Official PBP Results</H3>
You probably know this by now, but we had 15 finishers at PBP:
    Tom Brett,Ken Carter,Greg Cox, Jan Heine,Bill Dussler,Ron
    Himschoot,Peter McKay, Wayne Methner,Dick Pado,Kent Peterson,Vince Sikorski, Mark Thomas,Jim Trout, Duane Wright and Terry Zrmhal. Congrats to all a job well done!<br><br><b>Special Note:</b>Mark Thomas and Terry Z both had to ride through some physical problems.  
Mark had what he thought was Achilles tendonitis.  It started back when he did the 1000 km on Vancouver Island. 
It came back early on in PBP, but he took pills and rode through it.  An MRI showed it was a torn calf muscle...
TerryZ had stomach problems, and did most of the ride drinking Sprite and eating fruit - a tough way to get 
enough calories.<br><br>Unfortunately (7) of our members did not finish PBP. Listed below are each of them with the 
"showstopper" listed besides their name. My hat goes off to each of these riders who gave it all they had...
 good job!! I hope each of you had a great adventure!<br><br>Here are our results of PBP99 from the ACP website.

<a name="V4I8A6"></a><h3>Local Members recieve PBP press write-ups</h3><br>
 We have received some PBP press write-up with a picture in the color edition of CYCLO PASSION Magazine. The picture is of  SIR riders Mark Thomas and Peter McKay. Way to go guys! Boy, those jerseys sure look nice!
<br><br>
<A HREF="tanniere.jpg"><IMG SRC="tanniere.jpg" ALT="Mark Thomas and Peter McKay during PBP" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=90 BORDER=1></A>
<br><br>
<a name="V4I8A7"></a><H3>PBP Excerps from Kent Peterson</H3>
<BR><BR>
We'd all started in the second wave of the 90 hour group, leaving Saint Quentin at 10:15 PM on Monday August 23rd. The really fast guys, the 80 hour riders had pulled out at 8:00 PM, the velo specials (recumbents and tandems) left at 9:45 PM. The first wave of 90 hour riders took off at 10:00 PM. Behind us was another wave of 90 hour riders and at 4:00 AM on Tuesday the 84 hour riders would start. The theory of the staggered starts is that the really fast riders can blast through while the controls are relatively clear and the rest of the field sorts itself out as the ride progresses.
<BR><BR>
Another theory is that you follow a route sheet and the glowing arrows (Fleche) that mark the route. In practice you just follow the tail lights of the rider in front of you. This works great as long as somebody in the group actually keeps track of where you are going but in the heat of the moment and the dark of the night, it's easy to miss a turn.
But now we see a reassuring Fleche. Sighs of relief are the same in any language. We're back on course and we roll into the darkness of the Normandie countryside.
<BR><BR>
PBP is a huge ride with thousands of cyclists from all over the world. First held in 1891, PBP is billed not as a race but as a test, a 1200 kilometer ride to be completed in 90 hours or less. Riders are basically self supported, carrying all they'll need for the journey on their bikes. A rider may accept help from a support crew at control points that punctuate the course at approximately 100 kilometer intervals but the use of a support crew is not encouraged. In addition to accepting help at the controls, a rider may live off the land, stopping at stores and cafes. We can also accept support from the French farmers and villagers we meet along the route. But one important thing to understand and remember is that the clock doesn't stop for sleep, for food breaks, for anything. For most of us, the goal is not to win, but to finish.
<BR><BR>
Of course there are some "racers", although professionals are not allowed in PBP. The truly fast have taken off in the 80 hour group, committing to a completion time at least ten hours faster than what I've signed up for. These riders will live on Gu, not sleep at all, and ride for speed. The fastest will be back at Saint Quentin in under 45 hours. In the odd logic of PBP, I find this fact comforting. It lets me tell myself that what I am doing is rational.
<BR><BR>
"Rational" in this case means that I've spent the past year of my life focused on this event. I've crawled out of a warm bed at 2:00 AM on cold rainy Sunday mornings to ride 300 KM training rides in the Cascade mountains near my home. I've ridden hundreds of kilometers of qualifying brevets with other similarly demented individuals. I've obsessed over every detail of my bike, my lights, my clothing and my tools. It's perfectly rational to spend thousands of hours in training and thousands of dollars in transit to ride 1200 kilometers through a thoroughly foreign country.
<BR><BR>
I am here and I am riding.
<BR><BR>
An odd thing happened when I landed in France. In America, I'd never been able to think in kilometers. I'd tried switching my bike computer over to kilometers and riding my routes, but my brain was always converting to miles and I'd convinced myself the the years of logging miles were too deeply ingrained for me to ever be able to make the switch. 
<BR><BR>
But when I unpacked my bike in France, I very simply switched the computer to kilometers and somehow my brain switched over. My hotel in Plaisir was a bit under 13 kilometers from the PBP start in Saint Quentin and I never even thought what that distance was in miles. I knew it in kilometers and I knew how long it would take to ride.
<BR><BR>
Similarly, my tiny knowledge of French made me a child again. I probably understood fewer words than your average intelligent French dog, but I was never thinking "Oh why don't you people speak English?" I was intent on figuring out how to get by with my minimal vocabulary and learn what new words I'd need to get by. This filled every day with tiny victories and wonderful discoveries. The simple act of walking into a bookstore and successfully buying a map was an accomplishment equal in my mind to independently inventing calculus.
<BR><BR>
I learned to work French cash machines, eat French food and find my way on French streets. Of course, there was much I didn't understand but I was learning that I could get by. I could do this.
<BR><BR>
My lovely wife knew far more French than I and while I'd be out riding she would fearlessly explore Paris. She would see paintings and cathedrals and gargoyles. I'd see four thousand tail lights and a hundred small villages along the road from Paris to Brest and back.
<BR><BR>
Now I'm on the road, my phrase book back at the hotel and all I know had better be all I'd need. I feel great.
<BR><BR>
We are out of the suburbs of Paris now and out into the countryside of Normandie. The roads are incredibly smooth, the night is incredibly dark and we are a small rolling city of cyclists. At times I see a glow of lights up ahead and think we are coming into a town but it turns out to only be a cluster of bike head and taillights.
<BR><BR>
In the dark of the Normandie forest we pass many riders and are passed by others. On one climb, we roll by the most special of the velo specials, a fellow cranking his way over the course on an arm-powered trike.
<BR><BR>
It's a long way to the first control and somewhere in the night there is a small village and a bar that is open. Many riders choose to press on but many of us choose to stop. Back in the states I never drink Coca Cola but here "Coca, si vous plait!" and a few francs is all I need to refuel and recharge.
<BR><BR>
It's the small hours of the morning and there are very few cars on the road. But even in the middle of the night, there are French farmers and villagers waiting by the road side, encouraging us as we pass. "Bon Courage!" they call and "Bon Route!". The Anciens of PBP had told me about this but hearing about it and living it are two very different things.
In the dark it's hard to tell the nationality of riders, but certain rules of thumb are true more often than not. Americans are on the techno bikes with awesome lights. The French are riding older bikes at a consistent pace and they tend to have feeble lights. The Brits have mud guards, big Carradice saddle bags and dynamo-powered lights. Another safe bet is that if a bike is odd, it's pilot is a Brit. Many of the recumbents, the fixed gear bikes, and the trikes have British riders.
<BR><BR>
I'm bundled up against the cool night air in my trusty brown wool sweater which covers my Seattle jersey and effectively masks my nationality. Add the fact that I'm riding a Bike Friday that looks suspiciously like a Moulton in the dark and you'll understand why I found myself in variants of the same conversation many times in the course of PBP. I'd be riding along, either passing or being passed by someone and he'd look over and say "English?" I'd reply "No, American!" and my companion would look doubtful. I wound up meeting a lot of the British riders this way.
<BR><BR>
The classiest fellow on all of PBP was Drew Buck, a Brit riding a 1904 Dursley Pedersen. When I first saw him the first night, I wrongly assumed he was riding one of the modern Pedersen replicas. Another fellow set me straight -- Drew's bike is a lovingly restored 1904 three-speed. Later, at one of the controls, I had a chance to chat briefly with Drew and he showed me the beautiful, almost clock-like gear mechanism. Drew rode with great style, carrying all his provisions in a wicker basket on the front of his bike.
<BR><BR>
At 4:30 AM, I pull into the feeding stop at Mortagne Au Perche. On the outbound leg of PBP this technically isn't a control point, but it does give me my first indication of what the controls will be like. It's crowded, loud and busy. I munch one of my granola bars and buy an Orangina. I leave at 4:55 AM and somehow I don't feel very rested by this rest stop.
<BR><BR>
I keep riding, waiting for sunrise. I begin to feel quite tired and the thought of a quick nap keeps bubbling to the top of my list of things to do. I tell myself that if I see a good place to stop, I'll rest for a bit. A bit later, I see a nice gate in front of a small farm house. I pull over and sleep for ten minutes.
<BR><BR>
The nap was wonderful and now I'm alert, back on the road and the sun is up. I'm thinking about the time because in PBP you not only have to finish in a set amount of time, you also have to hit the control points within certain time limits. I always want to have some time "in the bank" to allow for mechanical problems, getting lost, rough terrain or other unforeseen circumstances.
<BR><BR>
I reach the control at Villaines La Juhel at 9:08 AM. I now have a three hour buffer built up and this control is lovely and well organized. I have my booklet stamped and my mag card scanned and I have a nice lunch at the "self", a self-serve buffet. I get all of this done within the space of an hour. I see some of the other Seattle riders here and they ask how I'm doing. "Great," I reply, "I'm living the dream!"
<BR><BR>
And this is a dream come true. Cycling in France is amazing. We are the kings of the road. The French people are cheering us on and the drivers are courteous and skillful. If they can't pass you, they won't. They will hang back patiently until it is safe to pass and they don't honk their horns. If they can pass you, however and they can clear by even a centimeter, they will pass at top speed. It's a bit disconcerting at first but my awe at the skill of French drivers increases with every passing kilometer.
<BR><BR>
Even the French dogs are different than American dogs. In general, they do not bark as we pass and they never give chase. The only dogs that bark are the ones locked behind gates. 
If a French dog is out, you may safely assume it is a civilized dog.
<BR><BR>
We are now cycling through hilly farmland. It's not very steep and in general the hills aren't long, but the countryside is virtually never level. My Bike Friday climbs very well and I've trained in the Cascade mountains so I'm really enjoying the ride. But the sun is beating down and it's getting very warm. As the day progresses, I peal off layers until I'm down to my shorts and jersey. I tie my bandana to the back of my helmet to keep the sun off my neck.
<BR><BR>
At one point I run out of water but at the next village there are French children calling out "de l'eau" so I stop and they fill my bottles. The local water is wonderful and tastes even better as the temperature climbs.
<BR><BR>
It's really getting hot now and by the time I pull into Forgeres at 2:00 PM, I'm thinking more about thirst than hunger. I buy and drink three cans of orange juice and get a couple of big bottles of water. I spend 50 minutes at this control.
<BR><BR>
Whenever I stop, I get quizzed about the Bike Friday. The French people love the bike, calling it the "petit velo" (little bike) and many of them ask is I have to pedal harder because of the little wheels. I point to the big front sprocket and assure them that it is a "bon petit velo" (good little bike) and do a pantomime of how the bike can fold up to fit in a suitcase. Many people take pictures of the bike. When I'm stopped at places with my friends who have recumbents, I see that Bike Friday and the recumbents get about the same amount of attention. We'd probably only get slightly more attention paid to us if we'd chosen to ride PBP naked!
<BR><BR>
I'm seeing people I know at almost every stop but I'm really not riding with any specific group. Like I'd done on the qualifying brevets, I'm riding my own ride and sticking to a pace that feels right for me. This means I sometimes I stop to eat and other times I eat on the bike. In my saddlebag and the pockets of my Camelbak I have fig newtons, granola bars and cashews.
<BR><BR>
I pull into the next control at Tinteniac at 6:00 PM. It's really warm and I'm anxiously awaiting the cool of the night. I spend 50 minutes at the control and then I'm off again. With the heat, I'm drinking lots of juice and eating very little. 
<BR><BR>
At 11:25 PM, I pull into

<br>                                 KM              Miles           Trip Dist.
<br> St Quentin En Yvelines          0               0               0
<br> Loudeac                 441             273             273
<br> Loudeac                 761             472             199
<br> St Quentin En Yvelines          1202            746             274
<br>
<BR> The distances shown above reflect a possible 3 day ride scenario with 2 nights in Loudeac. The 273 miles out on day 1 is comparable to doing Cannonball (only more hills). Day 2 would be doing STP (only more hills) and the last day would be doing Cannonball again (only ....you got it ... more hills). The opportunity to come up with a game plan before getting to Paris helps to visualize expectations. I will be going through several scenarios within the next couple weeks and hope to develop a realistic plan to follow.<br><br><b>Ken Carter</B>

<h3><b><a name="V4I6A4"></a> A Beautiful Ride</b></h3>

<h5>by K. Carter</h5>
<br><br><font size="3"><font=arial>
The morning of the 1000 km was a slow start for everyone except John Campbell. He had been waiting patiently for whoever else was ready to ride from Dave and Ninas' home near Stanwood out to SR9 and onto Sedro Woolley. I was late and had to call Dave to verify I was on the correct road. Jim Trout also called to get better directions and Ron Himshoot was just late. We all left around 4:30 am Friday and headed to Sedro Woolley, 40 miles into the ride. Jim and I separated from John and Ron sometime before getting to SR 9. It was cool out so most of us had jackets on. This was to be the last time until descending down Rainy Pass that I would need a jacket. The route took us from Sedro Woolley to Sumas and on into Canada to Highway 3 heading East. The highway was flat, smooth and there was a great tail wind. Averaging around 25 to 28 was a great motivator for the beginning of a long ride. Jim and I bumped into each other at Hope, B.C. and then at Manning Park Resort. The route climbed
 immediately out of Hope up a steady 6% grade and then forked off to the right and headed up towards Allison Pass at a 7% grade. The steep climbing ended about 3 or 4 miles where we crested at a rest area below a huge rock slide on the north side of the canyon. From approximately 2300 ft the route descended about 1200 ft and leveled out and followed the river until climbing up to Allison Pass (4335 ft) within Manning Park. At the Manning Park Resort Dave met Jim and I to offer some food and drink. We both rested about an hour and then Jim left and I tailed behind since he reached the pass ahead of me. From Allison Pass we went onto Sunday Pass (3000 ft) and had a brief fast descent until construction held up the cars due to the chip seal being applied to the road. Pilot cars took everybody along a 12 mile stretch of dust and loose rock. This was to be the worst road condition of the whole ride. After going through the construction the remaining descent down to Princeton was f
antastic! The highway continued at a steady 1 % downgrade alongside the river for about 40 miles to Keremeos and then climbed over a small pass to descend once again into Osoyoos 20 miles away. Osoyoos is just 5 kms from the US/Canadian border and in a wide open farmland community. I stayed at Keremeos, BC after arriving there at around 10:30 pm. The ride to Osoyoos would have kept me up until 12:00 or 12:30 am and that was to long of a day. So after a good nights rest I rode into Osoyoos and into the US down SR 97 to Omak and Okanogan. After a good lunch and topping off the water bottles I climbed out of the Okanogan river basin and up a hot windy 7% grade to Loup Loup Pass. It was 93 degrees in Okanogan and seemed to be getting hotter the more I climbed. Even squirting water on myself  seemed to help for a short time. But it took two stops along the way to finally reach Loup Loup summit 18 miles later. The ten mile descent to reach the Methow Valley just two miles outside of!
 Twisp was refreshing yet short lived. The highway to Twisp was a battle between the wind and I. This was a slow process of watching out for cars and staying tucked down low to minimize the headwinds bucking me around the narrow shoulder. I stopped briefly for a soda and chicken in Twisp and then decided that enough was enough. I would ride into Winthrop and after checking into the control get a good sit down meal and then stay the night. Arriving at 5:00pm at the control I was pleased to beable to eat and then sleep at a leisurely pace. A night of sleep in the middle of a long ride can and most often has given me many anxious moments waking up during the night. It must be the excitement of getting back on the road. This was just like the first 1000 km I did back in 1995, only the quality of sleep was better this time. I awoke and decided to start riding at 5:30am. The amount of light outside was enough to ride without lights and I hoped to get up to Washington Pass (5400 ft) be!
fore the heat of the day started warming things up. I was lucky, because the temperature was cool and I used the leg and arm warmers until partway up the Pass. Upon reaching the top I saw a support vehicle for Ron and John. Don Harkleroad had volunteered to support them and I chatted for a few minutes until Ron came up the pass to rest. He and John had come into Winthrop around 12:00am and made it to the bottom of the hill where they found accomodations at a very expensive Inn. After our brief talk I put on my jacket and rode to Rainy Pass where I had to put on leg warmers and arm warmers to keep from chilling. The ride into Newhalem was beautiful like usual and I met Ron and John for some lunch. The ride back to Darrington and onto Daves' house was a warm and beautiful summer sunset. Even though the ride was short in mileage I was glad to see more of Canada and to ride over the North Cascades. I don't know of any other route over Washington and Rainy Pass that I could ride and 
never grow tired of...well okay, except for the RAMROD route. Thanks to Dave and Nina for the ride and hope to do the route again with a full 1000 km distance.<br><br></font>

    <H4>Photon Lights</H4></B><BR><BR>I purchased a blue photon light for nighttime riding last week for $24.00, and I am really pleased with its 
    performance. I purchased the light for route card reading and possibly a 
    backup headlight in case my primary system failed. What a compact bright night
    light. I used the light on Race Across Oregon last week with great 
    results. I clipped the light to my jersey and left it on so traffic had a 
    extra light to see me and it allowed me to read any route literature I 
    needed along the ride. I am going to purchase a light for each of my family 
    members for other outdoor activities. Go to <A

    this small, but bright light.<BR>

<H3><A name=V4I6A3></A>Olympic Peninsula 600 km Summary</H3>
<H5>By Pete Bajema</H5><BR><BR>25 faithful riders started out on the quest to 
finish the Olympic Peninsula 600 km in Bremerton at 6:30a On Saturday May 22. 
Several of the today's riders are riding this brevet so they can finish the 
brevet series and qualify to ride PBP this year. Unlike the the previous brevet 
the weather was magnificent at the start and would continue throughout the ride. 
It is amazing how the group spreads out right from the start, as everyone gets 
in their own groove necessary to finish the long and challenging ride. The 
Olympic Peninsula route, new this year, has many unknown for the riders like 
hills and remoteness of the route. I remember saying to myself as I was 
pre-riding the course there will not be enough hills to give them a taste of 
PBP. I think many of the riders had the say preconception too. I couldn't have 
been farther from the true as there was a total of 15,600 ft of elevation gain 
during the ride. As like most of the other brevets, Jan, Terry, Vince and Jim 
went out to the front, with Bill flatting not far from the start twice, bring up 
the rear. There is nothing like flatting that close to the start of a ride!! 
Greg Cox and Ken Carter, who pre-rode the course with me the previous week, help 
with the control stops. Ken would set up in the middle of nowhere along Hwy 112 
and Greg would set up camp at LaPush. His site was later renamed Greg's Gourmet 
deli stop for the variety of food available...Thanks Greg!.Riding was much 
better this week as last week we had rain and wind for much of the 2nd day of 
riding. I am glad we did not have a repeat performance!. A sleep over stop was 
set up in Port Angeles with (3) rooms at the SUPER 8 MOTEL. First to arrive was 
the trio of Jan, Vince and Terry at 10:39p followed by Jim at 12:10p. While the 
first trio decided to get a good night rest, Jim decided to move on after 
fueling up and resting for ~1hr. I was amazed at how fresh he looked when he 
headed back out on the road! Soon after the rest of the group trickled in and 
took their breaks. Everyone looked in good spirits except for Melissa who spent 
some time in Crescent Lake with a space blanket (Burr!!!) taking the edge of the 
tiredness before heading onward to Port Angeles. I was extremely pleased seeing 
everyone reach the rest stop as most of the hard riding was over, and they were 
back into civilization. Jim Trout was the first rider in at 12:40p with Ron and 
Lynne rounding out the group at 9:40p. A special congratulations goes out to 
Lynne whose stomach went south on here earlier in the ride. I remember her 
saying nothing was getting in the way of finishing the ride. Good Job Lynne! All 
in all 23 out of 25 riders completed the challenging brevet, which is testament 
to the riders strength and commitment. Good job group!!! Below I have times for 
each of the riders who completed the brevet.

<H3><a name="V4I6A4"></a>Race Across Oregon</H3>
<H5>Pete Bajema</H5><BR><BR>    Last weekend I competed in the Race Across Oregon, a 
500 mile RAAM qualifier that had 30,000+ FT of climbing. It was a first year 
event put on by George Thomas benefiting the Epilepsy foundation of Oregon. We 
had a great turnout as 12 solo riders and a total of 60 riders turned out for 
the event. The course started out at Ontario OR and transverse West on Hwy 26 
to Portland where we connected on Hwy 30 for a remainder of the race to Astoria. 
the weather was fantastic as temperature were in the low 90's during the 
afternoon, but got rather cold with upper 30's at night in the mountains.</B>
<p>    <B>My 
race started out pretty easy as we rode out together thru Ontario (8 miles) 
before really starting. I was targeting to shadow one of the (2) RAAM Qualifiers 
in the race and stay out near the front. It went pretty much as planned as the 
(3) of us traded of taking the lead and playing the cat-mouse game. Our first 
climb came at mile 45 with Brogan Hill. All (3) of us climbed the hill fairly 
easily. We never looked back from there as I only saw one other solo rider from 
there on. After the climb I was having problems with my stomach as I started out eating too many 
solid foods and the body was not processing it. Thanks to my crew, we switch 
back to the Twin Labs 2500 cal weight gainer Liquid food and recovered within the hour. Thing were 
going great till about mile 200 when I started to develop "hot feet". I have 
since been diagnosed with Morten's Neuroma, an inflammation of the metatarsal bones 
pinching the nerves. I tried many things with limited success. The feet really 
acted up while climbing which played a key role in the final standings. </p>
<p> I 
covered ~375 miles in the first 24hrs which was close to my target of 400/24hrs 
due to strong head winds along most of the climbs. Made it into Portland in 2nd 
place only 30 minutes behind the leader, feeling pretty good. Feet were really 
hurting on the last 70 miles, especially the last 30 miles where it seemed to be 
one big hill into Astoria. With ~20 miles to go, Harold Trease one of the RAAM 
qualifiers passed me on the "hill from hell". Once over the top I gave chase and 
nearly caught him, until my feet gave out. I ended up finishing in 3rd place, 
and the 1st Non-RAAM qualifier with a time of just over 33 hrs. I owe this 
mostly to my crew of Tim & John Kinkeade, who kept me on the bike for more 
than 32 hrs of it, and keeping my calorie count up. I consumed over 22,000 
calories for the race! Now its time to get ready for RAAM 2000 in Portland!

<p>We had several people out for the make-up brevet series hosted by Terry Zmrhal.
We had many DNF's due to people having the series already completed, wanting a
long distance ride for Saturday. The weather was nice for a change and most
everyone who needed to complete the series, did. Congratulations to those
finished. I would like to offer a special thanks to Guy Oldfield who although
didn't finish the 600 km was riding on such short notice after a trip to the

<H3><a name="V4I6A6"></a> My Experiences at the Victoria 1000 km</h3>
<h5>by Mark Thomas</h5>
<br><br>
<font size="4">What I learned on the BC 1000 km:</font>
<p>About SPACE & TIME</p>
<p></b>1. It's a 
long way from one end of Vancouver Island to the other; it's also a long way 
back.<BR>2. A thousand kilometers is a lot farther than the other brevets. 
(In fact, I calculated that it is 400 km longer than the 600 km).<BR>3. It's 
possible to get 25,000 feet of climbing and never get above<BR>1500feet.<br>4. 
The distance from 800km to 900km is significantly longer than the distance 
from 900km to 1000 km. Einstein would attribute this to relativity. Wayne 
Methner would probably say that it's the smell of the barn.<BR>5. 170 kilometers 
is a really long distance between controls, especially at night with nothing 
open.<BR>6. It is much less demoralizing to climb a hill when your computer 
says 10km/hr than when it says 6mi/hr.<br>7. You can calculate the time to 
the next control by (1) converting the distance to miles; (2) taking your 
likely average speed in km/hr and converting it to mi/hr; and (3) dividing 
one into the other. There is also a much easier and direct method, but it 
does not immediately occur to you at 3am. Also it doesn't pass as much time. 
<BR><BR><b>About PHYSIOLOGY</b><BR><BR>1. You really can go and go on a long ride with 
as powder for power. (I used about 12,000 calories worth of Twin-labs Gainers 
Fuel 2500). All you need are a scientifically chosen collection of 
supplements to the powder. Mine included a Spanish omelets and bacon, 
bananas, a sausage and pepperoni pizza, ham and cheese sandwiches, chicken 
and cheese sandwiches, ice cream, mushroom soup, French fries, a salmon and 
bacon club sandwich, oatmeal, onion rings, grapes, a blueberry scone and 
other similar nutrients.<BR>2. If you use large amount of bag balm and reapply 
generously every 200 km, your butt will thank you. Makes the saddle awfully 
slippery, though.<BR>3. It was a lot easier when I was a lot younger to get by 
on two hours total sleep in two nights.<BR>4. Odd things can start hurting at 
odd times. For example, one forearm?!?<BR><BR><b>About GEAR</b><BR><BR>1. If you add 
a bigger bag, you will pack more. This apparently has no connection with the 
odds that you will not have something that you end up wanting.<BR>2. You 
cannot carry enough dry socks.<BR>3. Lithium batteries have a different 
discharge curve than other batteries. My battery tester was apparently unable 
to distinguish between fresh and largely used batteries.<BR>4. Although two 
Cateye halogen lights with fresh batteries will last for 10 hours; two such 
lights with largely used batteries will last for about a half-hour 
each.<BR><BR><b>About the ENVIRONMENT</b><BR><BR>1. If it's only going to be sunny for 
a few hours on a 3 day rainy ride, you can still sunburn yourself.<BR>2. The 
difference between Canadian convenience store attendants and their American 
counterparts is that they say "Crazy; I wouldn't do that in a car, eh" 
instead of "Crazy; I wouldn't do that in a car."<BR>3. Bald eagles look really 
cool (and big) when they swoop down in the road in front of cyclists.<BR>4. 
It isn't summer yet on Vancouver Island either.<BR><BR><b>About OTHER 
RIDERS</b><BR><BR>1. If (1) you plan to ride with folks you don't really know, (2) 
they say that when they hit the 400 km control, they are going to turn around 
and keep riding, and (3) you get there an hour earlier, then you should not 
have a large cup of coffee while waiting. (They may decide on a sleep 
break instead!)<BR>2. If no one from the local club shows up for a brevet, 
maybe they know something about the weather that you don't know.<BR><BR><b>What 
I'm still curious about:</b><BR><BR>1. Can you dry socks in a convenience store 
microwave?<BR>2. How exactly are you supposed to execute a roadside bathroom 
break with tights on over bibs?<BR>3. Is summer coming this year?<BR>4. When 
will my body feel normal again?<BR>5. How much agony will another 200 km bring in 
France?<BR><BR></p>
<h4>Ride description:</h4><BR><BR>I headed up to Canada on Thursday to 
ride the BC 1000 km brevet on Vancouver Island on Friday-Sunday. The route 
extends from Victoria at the south end of the island to Port Hardy at the 
north end and back. I was actually planning to start in between at Nanaimo, 
heading north to PH, south to Victoria, then back to Nanaimo. 25,000 feet of 
climbing were advertised. 75 hours was the time limit.<BR><BR>During the 
previous week, I found out that I was going to be the sole SIR rider on the 
ride. A couple of other guys had decided after Terry's 3-pass 400 km that they 
needed more recovery time or had better things to do. I was determined to go 
anyway - I had started by thinking that 1000 km might be a good way for me to 
prepare for PBP, get some experience above 600 km before attempting 1200 km, 
and to do a real shakedown on me and my equipment while I still had a couple 
months to make adjustments. As the ride got closer, I got passionate about 
it, and I wanted the ride a lot. I abandoned the 400 at Cle Elum to "save 
myself" for the 1000.<BR><BR>Since the 600 km, I had made a few changes to my 
equipment, despite the oft-heard admonitions about not making any changes 
after the 400 km. I had abandoned my "fancy-schmancy" (Kent Peterson's term) 
wheels for ones with lots of spokes. I had given up my hydration backpack 
(which I had a bad habit of overpacking, to my back's great detriment) and a 
small under seat bag. Instead I was using a seat-post mounted rack with a 
reflective trunk on top and 2 collapsible water bottles to supplement the 2 on 
the bike for long waterless stretches. I had switched from shorts to bibs 
with a different pad. Another switch was to Bag Balm from the Assos chamois 
cream that I had used for two years. I intended to complete a brevet on my 
Litespeed for the first time since the 200 km pre-ride, so I added fenders. At 
the suggestion of Bill Dussler and others, I was going to rely heavily on 
drink powders for my calorie intake, so I had packed about a zillion ziplock 
baggies filled with weight lifters' drink mix.<BR><BR>My vague plan was to 
meet up with two riders from Portland (George Wilson and Scott Aldrich). I 
had met George along Lake Crescent during the SIR 600 km. Scott's wife, Carol, 
was planning to support them, especially for the long stretch between 
controls at the north end of the island. I was happy to go along with their 
ride plan - start on Friday and ride 630km from Nanaimo to Port Hardy and 
back to Campbell River for a sleep stop on Saturday night; then the remaining 
370km on Sunday. More than 600 km without stopping would be a new experience 
for me.<BR><BR>Friday morning, I met George and Scott and Stephen Hinde of the 
BC club at the local 7-11 in Nanaimo. It turned out that we were going to be 
the only three riders starting that morning. A member of the BC club was 
planning to do the ride on Sunday/Monday, starting in Victoria. His plan was 
to complete the ride in 40 hours, so I wasn't expecting to see much of him 
even if we had started together. Stephen gave us our brevet cards (it took 
two to get all the controls on). He also gave us a new route sheet with 
some construction-motivated detours that would add about 10km to the 
distance. (This seemed irrelevant at the start, but assumed unnatural 
importance at 995km into the ride). I tossed my bag drop bag into Carol's 
car.<BR><BR>The ride started nicely. Shorts, jersey, and vest were adequate 
attire and we headed down to the water along the old highway toward the first 
control at Qualicum Beach (46km). This went by quickly and I got to know 
George and Scott a bit. George is a veteran of several PBPs; Scott, like me, 
had taken up randonneuring last year and was aiming for Paris. After a quick 
stop at the control, we set out for the next control at Willow Point near 
Campbell River (147km). This was great riding, much of it along the old 
island highway. My only mechanical difficulty of the whole ride - a flat tire 
from a piece of wire embedded in the tread - was quickly fixed. The weather 
held up and provided a wonderful tailwind. The scenery included offshore 
islands and a spectacular bald eagle flying above the road just in front of 
us.<BR><BR>After lunch in Campbell River we headed inland. We were greeted by a 
couple of very long but not very steep climbs and the beginning of the rain 
that would dog the ride all weekend. I also started to ride a little faster 
and began to ride by myself. By the time I got to Charlie's Place, 
the restaurant at the next control (219km), it was pouring. The restaurant 
had a number of friendly local folks, many of whom had pithy observations 
about our sanity, or perceived lack thereof. Some were eager to point out 
that there was basically nothing, particularly at night, for the next 170km. 
One said that there was one big hill coming up after the control and then 
pretty much flat the rest of the way. She lied, but not about the 
hill.<BR><BR>With French fries and mushroom soup to stoke the fires and with a 
rain jacket and tights added to my attire, we set off in the rain to Port 
Hardy. After a few long hills, the rain actually let up a little and we had 
decent riding. By then I was out by myself again. With the exception of some 
ugly clear-cut, it was a beautiful and peaceful place to ride. Hardly any 
traffic either. Carol Aldrich had planned to set up water/food stops at about 
the 1/3 and 2/3 points of this stretch. Her big white Suburban was a 
welcome sight each time - loaded up with water, drinks, fruit, hot soup, and 
the good cheer of Carol and their kids. Carol also offered welcome 
encouragement each time she drove past on the road. She set up the first stop 
at the turnoff to Woss, a logging camp. There I waited for George and Scott, 
but I got too cold, so the next time, I just filled up and set off and left 
word with Carol that I would meet the guys at the control in Port Hardy. In 
the meantime it had gotten dark, very dark. The stories that I had heard 
from Stephen about black bears and cougars watching passing randonneurs may 
have been true that night as well, but I didn't see them. I was intently 
watching miles and miles of pavement pass through the little square of light 
in front of my bike. Too intently, I guess, because at one point I looked up 
to find the sky filled with stars and realized that I had no awareness that 
it had been clearing. One great thing about riding in the middle of nowhere 
at night is that the stars are amazing - I turned off my lights and 
just enjoyed the sky for a bit.<BR><BR>At about 2:30 in the morning, I 
reached the convenience store at the Port Hardy control (389km). I had some 
more liquid food and a cup of coffee to set me up for the trip back. I have 
basically given up caffeine, in large part to give me the ability to use it 
as a drug when I need it. As a result, this cup of coffee packed a nice 
wallop. An hour later, George and Scott rolled in and announced that a brief 
sleep stop in a motel was in order for them. I agreed to join them and we 
checked into a nearby motel with a plan to wake up 1.5 hours later and head 
out. By now it was nearly 4AM and the sky was beginning to show the first 
hints of morning. The coffee kept me up for the first two-thirds of the sleep 
time, so I started off in the morning with all of 30 minutes of sleep in the 
bank.<BR><BR>I woke up to the sun rising outside my window. Despite the lack of 
sleep, I felt great as we headed out of town. After a leisurely few miles at 
the start, I headed off. Although I did not know it then, that was the last 
that I would see of George and Scott - I was to have the next 600 km to 
myself. After 50km, I saw the white Suburban, stopped for water and hot 
oatmeal and headed off. 60 km later, I made my own stop at the general store 
in Woss; Carol was back supporting George and Scott, who were tiring. I 
thoroughly enjoyed the first 150km of this stretch - the weather was good, 
the roads were nice, the views lovely, I felt physically and mentally strong. 
It was just great to be cycling.<BR><BR>Along the way I came across a very 
strange section of road. Looking ahead, the road clearly goes downhill for a 
couple of miles before bending out of sight. I find, to my disappointment, 
that it seems to be a lot of work to get downhill. I consider everything - 
rubbing brakes, dead legs - before checking my altimeter and seeing that I'm 
going uphill. I look ahead again  still looks like a downhill; I ride - 
still going uphill. Very weird. (I mentioned this to Stephen of the local 
club after the ride and he immediately identified the spot where I must have 
been and said that this was a common sensation.)<BR><BR>About 10km before the 
control at Charlie's Place (559km) the skies opened up again, ruining a great 
downhill into the control. Rain would be my faithful companion for the next 
450km. After a warm reunion with the staff of the restaurant, more comments 
on my sanity, and a nice lunch, I put on my raingear and headed off. My goal 
was to make it back to Nanaimo to spend Saturday night. The next control was 
back at Campbell River and it would be at 632k. This would be a personal best 
distance, which was a powerful incentive.<BR><BR>The hills on the way back to 
the Campbell River control were relatively easy in this direction as well, 
although the rain was tedious. At the Willow Point 7-11, I indulged in a 
mini-pizza - sausage, pepperoni, lots of cheese. Yum. Lights on for the next 
leg to the Qualicum Beach control (733km). Atone point Carol went by and 
said that she was heading into Nanaimo to get motel rooms. She put my bag 
drop bag in the room and brought a key back to me on the road. (Way above and 
beyond the call of duty - as with all her efforts all weekend!). It was 
around 2AM when I arrived at Qualicum Beach. By then I was pretty tired, but 
there was a shower and a bed just 46km away.<BR><BR>As I was preparing to leave 
Qualicum Beach, Carol drove up. She had lost her riders. The guy in the 
Willow Point control said that they had been there and looked strong. She 
decided to nap in her car at Qualicum Beach and wait for them. As I was to 
found out later after the ride, they were not to meet up again until 
mid-afternoon on Sunday. George and Scott had decided to overnight in 
Campbell River and also had decided that they would not finish the 
ride.<BR><BR>My trip into Nanaimo in the wee hours of the morning was torture. 
Although my legs were ok, I was extremely sleepy. I struggled to keep it 
going and to stay awake. Lots of speculation in my head about exactly what 
would happen in what order if I actually fell asleep on the bike - especially 
if going downhill. I also tried to determine which of the local businesses 
would think it least odd to come in and discover a Mylar-wrapped cyclist when 
they arrived in the morning. The fact that it was Sunday and most places 
would be closed completely eluded me. Somehow I made it to the Nanaimo 
control (778km) and backtracked a half-mile to the motel.<BR><BR>A shower was 
pure heaven, especially because I was taking off cycling clothes that had 
been unchanged for 48 hours - another personal best, but not one I care to 
repeat. (I was to be reminded of this nastiness again when unloading my car 
back at home on Monday night - yuck). Remembering all the randonneurs lore 
about 1.5 hour sleep cycles, I set up a wake up call, estimating (correctly) 
that it would take about a nanosecond to fall asleep.<BR><BR>I think it was 
about 9 on Sunday morning when I headed south to Victoria. I considered 
leaving my headlamp & battery pack to save weight, thinking that 11 hours 
would be plenty of time to do 230km, getting me back well before dark. 
Conservativism led me to pack the light, which I use for fast descents and 
roadside tinkering. I had no idea how far off my estimate would turn out to 
be.<BR><BR>The 116km to Victoria definitely marked my emotional low point for 
the ride. The perceived time for each 10km increment on my computer was 
interminable. No matter how many slugs off my flasks of strawberry-banana 
PowerGel (with caffeine!) I took, I couldn't get any kick. Thoughts of 
abandoning were a constant companion. I especially struggled with the "800km 
is quite an accomplishment; you don't need to jump all the way to 1000 km in 
one shot" thought. The one bright spot was a late breakfast. I rode past a 
little restaurant in Chemainus, on a detour to avoid construction on the 
main highway. Something about it called to me and I turned around and went 
in. It was a delightful little place, presided over by an older woman who 
seemed to know every customer and quite solicitous of the bedraggled cyclist. 
I ordered an omelet, which came with a choice of pancakes or toast. I 
asked for the pancakes, but she gently suggested that I might enjoy the 
bread, which she baked herself. By the time I left, I had consumed 8 slices 
of this delicious multigrain toast, along with a large Spanish omelet, 
hash browns, bacon, and fruit.<BR><BR>The route diverged from the main 
highway again around Shawnigan Lake. These backroads seemed like an endless 
series of short steep hills. I wasn't paying attention to my altimeter, so I 
didn't realize until I returned to the main road that there had indeed been 
more up than down - I was about 1000ft higher than when I left the main road. 
These hills, which would probably seem insignificant on a shorter ride, 
nearly broke my resolve. Luckily, I had no readily accessible bailout 
strategy. After rejoining the highway, the last 30km into Victoria were not 
too bad. There was a great long downhill, but my enjoyment was substantially 
tempered by dread of the climb on the way back.<BR><BR>I took a decently long 
break at the Victoria control (yet another 7-11, this one at 894km) and took 
in a sandwich and lots to drink. Also realized that I didn't have a prayer of 
finishing before dark. Turning around and heading for the finish completely 
turned around my state of mind. I stopped noticing the rain; the dreaded 
climb turned out to be not bad at all; and the kilometers seemed to roll by 
quicker. I wasn't going a lot faster, but the mental attitude was much 
better. I stopped several times for coffee on the way back and started to 
target a 66 hour finish (11:30PM Sunday). At Stephen's request, I telephoned 
him about 15km from the finish so that he could meet me at the final control. 
At that point it seemed like my finish target was receding from possibility, 
but I became like a demon possessed. I found myself sprinting up hills and 
feeling good about it. The smell of the barn was getting stronger. I rolled 
into the 7-11 at 11:15, high as a kite. Damn, I was thrilled.<BR><BR>I spent 
a little time talking to Stephen, who predicted that I would finish PBP and 
that according to his rule of thumb, I could expect to finish in 20 hours 
more than my 1000 km time. We'll see - those thoughts are for another day. A 
short ride to my motel room, a much needed shower, and a last big slug of 
weight gainer fuel and I was ready for a real night's sleep. I was still 
pumped up the next morning and enjoyed my completion high for 4-5 hours on my 
ferry and car ride back home. After 2 years of brevets, I finally have a real 
feeling of what randonneuring is all 
about.

<h3><a name="V4I5A1"></a>P-B-P Tidbits: May '99</h3>
<p><blockquote> Maps for P-B-P:
<blockquote>
  <i>Tip 1</i>: Buy the Michelin Road Atlas - Purchase a copy of
  last years
  Atlas from a discount store and tear out the pages you need 
It will cost no more (probably less) than 3 Michelin maps, gives you the whole of France to go at, 
and the pages you need will take up far less
space than the sheet maps.  The actual mapping is identical, as is the scale (1:200,000).<br>
  <br><i>Tip 2</i>: Michelin sheets 58, 59, and 60 cover the whole route
perfectly at 200 km scale
with enough detail to show the village streets. Michelin sheet 101 covering Paris at 50K is also useful, 
to cross Paris from the airport or station and get
to the start.
<br><br>
</blockquote>
<b>Cue Sheet Size</b><br>
<blockquote><i>Tip 1</i>:I believe the PBP cue sheets for '91 and '95 were approximately legal size,
but very hard to read, due to small print. Since the cue sheet for '99 will most likely be available in advance, it may be beneficial to plan to make your own easier to read cue sheets. THink about the size of plastic carrier you have and modify the size and print to fit it so it is easy to read with the flick of a flashlight at night.  The cue sheet from '95 is
available on the RUSA website at <a href="http://www.rusa.org">RUSA</a>.

<h4>Equipment Tip</h4>
<br>
I've got a tip that might be good for a future newsletter or to pass on to
some of the Rando riders via email. I was looking for a big wedge pack (the
kind that goes behind the seat) and couldn't find one. But when I was at
REI, I found a $55 Lowe camera bag that's designed to hold a 35mm camera
with a giant zoom lens. It's shaped just like a wedge bag. It's got one big
main pocket, a couple of smaller ones and plastic D rings to attach it to a
shoulder strap. I discarded the shoulder strap and used mini bungee cords to
strap behind my saddle. It works great, holds a lot and doesn't sway. Add
some reflector tape and an LED flasher and it  looks just like a bike bag.<br>

Here are the results from the Arlington 400 km held last week. Special thanks to Ron Lee for Hosting the event. As most of of you know the weather
 for the ride was less than optimal. Rain, Cold winds, and temperatures in the upper 30's - low 40's were the condition for most of the ride. Due to this we 
 had several DNF's for this ride, most being weather related. Congratulations to all of you who finished the ride. You should be proud of your accomplishments
 on this very tough ride!

Due to the large number of people who did not finish last weeks 400 km, we have scheduled a make-up on May 8th. 
It will cover the same route and start at 5am. Cost for the ride will remain the same. If you have further questions 
please send me a message.

</h3>
<h5>by Mark Vande Kamp</h5>
<Blockquote><Blockquote>
<br><br>
It's 2:50 A.M. and my alarm is beeping insistently. It's an ungodly hour to be awakened, but a bit of pre-ride trepidation has made my sleep light. With a limited degree of excitement I am setting out to ride the third in the Northwest Brevet series sponsored by the Seattle International Randonneurs. Work commitments have recently changed, allowing me to do the ride, but I haven't done much training since the 300 km approximately a month ago. That ride had turned into a sort of "night of the riding dead" for me and I am a little worried about adding to the challenge. Still, the alarm is off and I'm out of bed. Jan arrives at my house just as I bring my bike out to my car, and together we embark on an uneventful trip to Arlington where the ride begins at the Arlington Motor Inn. Thirty-two dedicated riders set off at 5:00 A.M. under dark, cloudy skies. It's about 50 degrees, and showers are predicted. Quickly, the lead group forms. Jan takes over Kendall's usual spot at the front of the early pace, joined by Andy, Paul (providing a primo draft on his mountain bike), Ken, Steve, and myself. I've made a personal vow not to be sucked into going too hard too early, but I feel comfortable as we begin rotating leads. My resolve is tested when we reach a long but gentle incline and Steve jumps ahead. Jan jokingly intones that Steve will pay a price for his early attack. But I'm happy when the group re-forms and the pace hasn't crept up beyond earlier levels. Steve does drop back not long after this time. We don't see him again until later. On the ride in, Jan had made it very clear that it always rains on the North Cascades Highway. When we make the turn onto the highway, he is soon proven right. Sprinkles begin as we make our way to the first control and turn-around point past Marblemount. We reach the control having made good time and take a bit of a break. I drink a can of Ensure Plus, a new type of ride-food for me, but one that seems to go down well, at least in the current cool conditions. I'm making conscious efforts to eat more calories, earlier in the ride, with the goal of preventing the nausea that made the 300 km and its aftermath very unpleasant. As we ride back West, we see the other riders in groups and singly. Everyone waves and looks good at this point. There is almost no other traffic on the road as it is still rather early on a Saturday morning and the road is closed for winter at a point beyond our turn-around. The clouds obscure the more grandiose scenery at altitude, but the trees and river are beautiful in their own right. Several of us have commented that moving toward the mountains had brought cooler air temperatures, but chilliness is really starting to creep in as the earlier showers have returned and intensified. It's a cold steady rain and although we all have fenders of some sort, Jan's mud-flap got torn off at some previous time and Paul's MTB fender does nothing to limit the water flying back at drafting riders. I seem to have one or the other of those wheels a good share of the time, and before long my jacket is covered with road grit. My strategy is to ride just slightly to the side and take the brunt of the spray on my shoulders rather than my face, but I also ingest my daily mineral requirements. It certainly isn't like last weekend when I rode a perfectly sunny 60 miler with Andy, Paul, and Kent, but it is an awful lot like the training rides we rode back in January and February. The first century has passed in a little less than five and a half hours. I'm wet to the skin but not feeling completely chilled as of yet. Unfortunately, when we stop in Sedro Woolley and hang out in the AM/PM all the cold blood from my extremities seems to rush to my core and I'm soon shaking and my teeth are chattering. Ken shares some hot cocoa but it doesn't seem to have much of an effect. I'm longing to get back on the bike simply to get moving again. My past experience is that I'll warm up much more quickly that way than by standing still, even in a warm store. Jan jokes about heading South to Arlington rather than continuing with the ride and it's hard to tell if he's serious. Eventually we set off again, and it's immediately apparent that the rain has slacked off a bit. Nonetheless, I'm shaking and am evidently matching the natural resonance of my bike frame, creating a speed wobble that is controllable but kind of humorous as I wobble through the raindrops. Experience from those training rides holds true again as a decent pace on the bike does more to warm me up than the cocoa or warm store. I still feel cold but I have on all the clothes I brought with me and I feel strong. The place I want to be is on the bike and making progress, and that is where I am. We soon find that we made the right choice by taking Jan's suggested route as a joke. Before fifteen miles have passed, the rain has ended and we get our first glimpses of blue sky. We pass through the "blink and you'll miss it" town of Deming and decide that we like it there. It's obvious that this town care's enough to keep its streets dry for bicyclists. We appreciate the effort. The weather has gotten better but unfortunately one of our
pace line is suffering. Andy has had knee problems and they are flaring up again. He decides to call a relative who lives in the area and get a ride back to Arlington. Discretion is the better part of valor, and Andy makes the better decision. Miles pass and we reach the border town of Sumas. We also turn back South into the prevailing wind and begin a long segment of switching between headwinds where we ride straight paceline and sidewinds where we ride varying echelons - narrow ones when the traffic and shoulder were limiting, and wide ones on the quiet roads. We are a group of four keeping a good pace and the miles roll under our wheels. Ken is the keeper of the route sheet and the head navigator, Jan is taking long pulls and Paul is doing likewise. I'm trying to hold up my part without burying myself or escalating things into a contest. Except for a two-mile stretch of nasty broken concrete on Sunrise road, the riding is on pleasant flat roads. Before long we've worked our way Southwest to Birch Bay and a wonderful control at a park on the Strait of Georgia. I have no more Ensure left and none of the sweets and snacks at the control appeal to my slightly balky stomach. I eat what sounds best (cheese flavored crackers) and hope to get enough calories to avoid bonking later. Still- sunshine, clouds, wind on the water, a sheltered spot with a propane heater, and a nice long rest off the bike do us all some good. 173 miles are done, less than a century to go. After our rest, Jan is eager to pick up the pace and I still feel pretty strong, so we push ahead of Paul and Ken. Jan takes on both the navigation and long-pull duties, and I do my best to maintain pace and provide company. Things go well until we reach the outskirts of Bellingham and I start to feel the dreaded beginnings of a bonk creeping in. One of the key indicators is a deep-seated, irrational feeling of extreme crabbiness. Luckily for Jan, we have been riding largely in silence, so my ill mood is kept largely to myself. I don't want to be the one to suggest stopping, but eventually I'm forced to tell Jan that I need to stop and eat. I'm hoping to see a grocery store where I can buy more Ensure, but none are to be found along the route through Bellingham. A very nice park overlooking Bellingham Bay does appear presently, and we pull over and take a seat on a park bench. One of the basic lessons of riding bicycle is that as long as you are moving, cyclists coming from behind take a long time to catch up. However, as soon as you stop entirely, you are quickly overtaken. You'd think that this simple idea wouldn't surprise me anymore, but the fact that Ken and Paul show up in a relatively short time somehow seems unexpected. I'm glad when they turn off the road to join us at the park. I'm not feeling as strong as when we split up and will appreciate more riders to share
pace line duties. Also, it's getting closer to the fall of darkness when it's nice to ride in a larger, more visible group. I manage to force down some of the crackers carried from Birch Bay and drink half a bottle or so of Gatorade and we set off again. Chuckanut drive is renowned in the Northwest as a scenic drive and with the sun setting over the water I'm sure it would be gorgeous if I had the spare mental energy to take it in. Unfortunately, my energy is taken up by trying to ride the right pace on the rolling hills, avoiding overlapping wheels, and making sure that no one (including myself) falls too far behind on the climbs to rejoin the group on the descents. Ken points out a park where in a past brevet he was forced by fatigue and cold temperatures to sleep on a restroom floor. I'm hoping that we all avoid such a fate tonight. I'm confident that we will, given that less than 60 miles remain and we are still moving at a decent pace. The final descent from the Chuckanut hills onto the Skagit flats reminds me that I rode this segment of highway only a month ago on the 300 km. It looked a lot different from the other direction. Only ten miles to the next control and about forty miles to the finish - it's really starting to feel like the home-stretch now. We stop briefly on Bow Hill road to turn on our lights and take a brief stretch. A passing car stops to ask directions. It's a high-school couple obviously on their way to the prom. With their fancy outfits and freshly-scrubbed appearance they make quite a contrast to four scruffy randonneurs. Ken fills them in on how to find their destination and they head one way while we head the other. We stop at the Texaco control on Highway 20 and although the stop seems relatively brief, time now seems to pass more quickly in the store than it does on the bike. A flat 21 miles to the final control at Stanwood is the next order of business. It's fully dark but the road is smooth, traffic is light, the winds are either dead or favoring us, and we are riding a well-practiced drill of moderate-length pulls. My legs still feel pretty good, but my upper back muscles are burning and cramping. I do my best to move around on my handlebars and stretch when possible, but mostly it's a matter of endurance at this point. We pass what seems to be just another rural home when suddenly three or four kids jump up in the ditch along side us and yell loudly before breaking out in peals of laughter. My heart skipped some beats and then quickly made up for it when the adrenaline hit. What were they doing out there on a cold night? It made no sense to any of us. In Conway we make the turn onto highway 530 and continue our smooth and silent trip through the darkness. I hear a sound behind us like an overtaking truck, but there are no headlights in my mirror. For a moment I'm confused and startled as the noise grows closer, louder than any truck. Then I realize that there are railroad tracks alongside the road and a freight train is coming alongside. We ride in the small pools of light cast by our headlights, our legs spinning a quiet rhythm while next to us, seemingly close enough to touch, the train rumbles forward with a harsh and forceful mechanical pounding that is almost overwhelming. I feel like it is drawing us forward, a force that both provides energy and mocks our puny efforts at the same time as it rumbles past. It's hard to tell how long we ride alongside the train, but before I have time to fully comprehend the scene, to break it down from the magic and power of its raw impact on my senses, the last car passes and the cacophonous, dark hulk of the train is fading away, leaving us behind to drop back to our comfortable pace. It is an experience I know I can never fully describe, but one I will never forget. I don't know exactly how far it is to the finish, but the rest of the ride will be anticlimactic. We make a very quick stop at the Stanwood control and leave the flats behind for the gently rolling route Southeast for I-5 and the Arlington Motor Inn that we left behind this morning. I haven't been watching the route sheet or mileage so I don't know the exact length of this final leg of the brevet. For once, this works in my favor as I'm surprised at how quickly we see the orange lights of the I-5 overpass. It's the final tiny obstacle before reaching the finish on the other side of the freeway. We ride into the parking lot together and are soon gathered in room 119 handing in our cards. It's about 18 hours since we left and it's very nice to be finished. Special thanks to Ron Lee and the rest of the crew who put on a great brevet. It was a challenging course in what seem to be typically difficult Northwest conditions. Lots of images and experiences that I won't forget, from the longest ride I've yet attempted.

<h3><A name="V4I5A6">
<h3><a name="V4I5A6"></a>A Wet Ride To Sedro Woolley
<br>
</h3>
<h5>by D. Wright</h5>
<br>
<blockquote><blockquote>
 I turned around and headed west. Between Marblemount and Sedro Woolley the
skies opened up and a cold deluge descended upon the land, and especially
upon the riders. It got worse and worse. I struggled to stay warm. My
upper back ached, my hands were so cold I had to shift with my palms. 

After about 15 miles of this torture I was hailed by Ron Lee (the ride
organizer), who'd stepped out of a car on the opposite side of the road.
He said he just wanted to know if I was o.k. (he was making a point of
checking on everyone during this freezing stretch). I yelled back that I
was o.k. and continued on, though I didn't know how much more I could
take. Up ahead I thought that the sky looked a touch lighter. A few
miles later and the rained seemed to be letting up. Eventually it
stopped, though I was now in pain all over.

It turned out that this squall was the downfall of many a rider. If there
was one lesson this rando season seemed to want to teach us it's that we
should always come dressed to do Iditabike.

The tandem (one of two on the ride) pulled along side and we exchanged
encouraging words. They pulled into a cafe and I followed. Once inside I
plopped myself down on a bar stool. But now I was feeling sick to my
stomach from the pain. I slid down the bar stool to t he floor, just to
make sure I didn't end up on the floor when not anticipating it.
Eventually I felt strong enough to walk to the men's room. There I sat on
the floor some more. Painful spasms shot through my arms and legs. I
couldn't get my gloves off because my fingers were useless. I longed just
to be able to feel well enough to take the shortest distance back to the
start, get in my car, go home, and go to bed.

Eventually I felt warmer and wandered out to the dining room and sat with
the tandem couple. Then I shook uncontrollably. Eventually I got my
gloves off by using my teeth. The waitress brought hot cocoa. Life
slowly returned to my limbs.

The captain had a huge meal but the stoker ate nothing. This was not a
good sign.

The sun came out and we scurried out to enjoy it. Well, actually, *I*
scurried out to discover a flat tire. By the time it was fixed not only
was the sun gone but it was raining again. Fortunately it was a light
rain and it ended soon.

At Sedro Woolley the course headed north along highway 9. I decided to
forget about my plan to quit and cautiously headed north.

<h3><a name="V4I5A7"></a>Notes from Southern California
<br>
</h3>
<h5>By Lynn Katano</h5>
<br><br>
<blockquote><Blockquote>
Our southernmost SIR member, Lynn Katano, has been doing her Fleche and brevet series in Southern California. She recently sent in this note on her randonneuring experiences: 
My lighting has worked out well. I ended up utilizing a Petzel Artic head light and modified it to mount on my stem. It runs on a 4.5 volt battery and utilizes either a standard 3 watt (11 hours) or halogen (6 hours) bulb. I also can mount one on my helmet for a great helmet light...it's super light and I put the battery pack in either my camel back or my jersey pocket. It was kind of fun working with my friend to devise the system! The Petzel headlight comes with a little storage area in the back to carry a spare bulb and arrives with both the 3 watt and the halogen, so depending on the intended use I stock which ever spare I need. As for the batteries, the 4.5v is the same as three AAs side by side...I carry one or two spares in my saddle bag as necessary or send one ahead to a bag drop if available. It's been a substantial improvement over the Cateye Micro that I'd been using previously (and whining about...) 
As opposed to asking about lighting systems, I should have asked about sleep deprivation! It's been my
nemesis on the 400 km, 600 km and Fleche...perhaps it was the combination of 30 degree temperatures and insufficient fueling, but at a certain point of the ride I'm on autopilot and struggling to stay on the road and on the bike!? Coffee and
Twinkies didn't even help...so I'm thinking about trying drugs?! It amazes me that I can keep
pedaling while I'm asleep!

Being a Southern Californian, I've had to learn ALOT about dressing for cold (I suppose, relatively for us!?) weather. Rain hasn't been as much of a problem this year, but our 400 and 600 routes found us riding in 30 degree temperature at the coldest parts. Unfortunately, I'm highly susceptible to the cold and end up looking like I'm doing the Iditarod by the time I get all of my layers on...but, layering is definitely the trick! I've also learned to not put on my windbreaker until I'm in dire need, thereby avoiding the sweating and freezing process that ultimately occurs. I think I was up to 2
Capeline undershirts, jersey, long-sleeved jersey, arm warmers, tights, wind pants, wind vest, fleece vest, rain jacket, booties, glove liners, long-fingered gloves and balaclava...and a H.A.W.G. Camelback to carry it all! That Alpine transit pack is looking pretty good...

Our Fleche was a self imposed ride from Hell. Silly us...we had two teams from So. Cal ride to Davis from Reedley...south to north. With 500 feet of elevation gain (Yes...500 feet) and a wind advisory the entire time, it was the most boring, most arduous ride any of us had ever done. We had 30-40 MPH winds a good portion of the ride. At 108 lbs and on a 46 cm bike...my friends almost tied a string on me to make sure I was still with them?! If they heard me shriek as a gust almost blew me off the road, they knew I was still
pedaling! 
At about 1am we turned North into the headwind onto Airport Road. After trudging along at what seemed like a snails pace for at least an hour, I began to realize that the scenery hadn't changed at all. Long stretches of open space broken up by factories illuminated by yellow streetlights. The road was straight and flat as far as the street lights continued. Since I couldn't see my odometer or my route sheet I had no idea how far we had come or when our next turn was. What I was more concerned about was when I could get a cup of coffee as I had begun pedaling in my sleep! I vaguely remember asking the tandem ahead of me how much further we had to follow this road and Bobbi responding with a chipper "Only 20 more miles!". Groan...

It was like being in a nightmare...a never-ending stretch of yellow lights, factories and open fields. And not an open convenience store in sight! I got so-o sleepy at one point that another rider and I curled up together on a freezing cold concrete slab in front of a bakery and dozed for 5 minutes while our teammates timed us. Didn't even realize the concrete was freezing cold! We struggled back on our bikes and after what was an eternity, we finally turned off that awful road and found coffee, apple fritters, frozen burritos and a warmer environment at an
AM-PM or something. I'm sure the attendant didn't know what to make of four riders ransacking the store and sleeping on his floor at 5 in the morning. 

I didn't find out until the trip home that every time I asked Bobbi "how much further" she would respond with "Only 20 more miles!" for what ended up being 40 torturous miles on that road?! I was so sleepy I never even caught on!?
It took us 24 hours just to complete the 360km. At that point we all just sat on a corner and waited for our vehicle to come get us...so much for our aspirations of riding 400 km! Then we had to listen to friends from No. Cal talk about their 50 mph tailwind and the great dinner they had at their hotel stop. Grrrr.... 
Well...I'm off to Santa Rosa for the Wine Country Century...so much for mega-miles this weekend. I hear a bottle of zinfandel calling to me...<br><h5>Lynn</h5>

<h3><a name="V4I5A8"></a>Thoughts on the Arlington 400 km Make-up <i>May 10-11</i>
<br>
</h3>
<h5> by Pete Bajema</h5>
<br><br>
Five brave souls started out on the 400 km make-up on May 10. As I was looking at the large volume of rain coming down at the start, I remember asking myself why am I doing this again. I now understand why my riding friends say I have gone off the edge... The ride started pretty much as the last one did, cold, rainy and no end of the weather in site. As we went through Arlington I remember looking at the bank's time/temp sign saying 35 degrees. Due to this inclimate weather the group of (5) which included John Wagner, Terry
Zmrhal, Andy Fuller, Tom Brett, and myself, choose to stick together and survive this nasty day. As we climbed in elevation, we encountered snow and what I perceived as colder temperatures. It was cold enough to numb my feet after only ~25 miles. I could hear the gremlins in the back of my mind saying quit and everything will be all
right. Fortunately I didn't take their advice! Once we got up to Marblemount the snow and rain had stopped and we could actually see the
sun <i>(My feet sure appreciated it!)</i>We all made it up to the 1st stop together around 9:30a and were greeted to hot cocoa and treats by Ken Carter and Max (thanks guy!!!) I remember thinking to myself that all we had to do was get to Sedro Woolley and the weather would get better... only 40 more miles... and sure enough I was right. We rode back thru the rain, heavy at times but nothing as bad as the last weeks downpour. We all joined back up at Sedro Woolley for the last time and relished the blue
skies and sun, we so badly needed. <br>As we all pulled out of Sedro, Terry and myself pulled ahead of the group and
cruised into Sumas around 4p. Weather was overcast but no rain in site <i>(what a relief!)</i>. Roads were good and traffic
light as we made our way to Birch Bay and Russ Carter's Trailer. It was nice to take a break and have some hot soup to warm up the bones.<br> Pulling out of Birch Bay we took a wrong turn and added ~5 miles to the course...the ironic thing about this is I live up in this neck of the woods and ride these roads on a regular basis. I guess I will chalk that one up to brain fade...Lights went on as we past the Chuckanut Manor heading out to the Skagit flats. We were blessed with only lite winds along this flat stretch of the course as we cruised on in to the last checkpoint in Stanwood. Now only 9 miles to go.... Why do these miles always seem to be the toughest? I remember the same problem, on the same road, on last years 600 km when it seemed to take forever... I start to feel refreshed as we rode over the last bridge out of Stanwood.  Just around the corner, lights will be marking the finishing area. What a pleasant site to see, as both we ride over the I-5 bridge to the finish at 12:30a, cold, tired and happy it is over. A nice course where the weather made it extremely challenging.

<h3><a name="V4I5A9"></a>Thought from the 1999 Fleche Pacifique</h3>
<br><br>
Eight teams participated in the 99 Fleche Pacifique, with routes generally converging on Harrison Hot Springs, in British Columbia. Our team, "Way of All Fleche," was the only non-Canadian team. Members included Dick Pado and Ron Himschoot on singles, and Greg and Ruth Sneed, and Lee Kanning and Duane Wright on tandems. Priceless support was provided by Nicole Nelson and Bonnie Lee Taylor The start of our ride was on highway 410, at Mud Mountain Road, which is about 4 miles east of Enumclaw. It was 7:00 a.m., Saturday morning, rainy and cool. The descent towards Enumclaw chilled and dampened us, but its been that kind of season. It also helped us racked up some quick miles, which was good for the morale. Then we headed north, through the tiny communities of Veazie, Cumberland and Hobart. We reached Issaquah in less than two hours. Then, in a shameless promotion of Cannonball (Ron said he was NOT buying!) we headed east on I-90. We took the second exit (all things, even Cannonball, are best in moderation), Preston, and descended to Fall City. Then east to Snoqualmie Falls, before retracing to Fall City. Then north through the Snoqualmie Valley (mostly on the west side), to Monroe, where we had lunch. By now the rain had stopped. From Monroe we continued north to Granite Falls and Arlington. Then on to Mt. Vernon, where we dined sumptuously at the AM-PM. By now everyone was feeling beat. It was 6:00 p.m. and we still had to make Bellingham. But the skies had turned mostly blue and we set out to battle the cross winds of Skagit Flats. Greg and Ruth looked tremendously strong all day. They inspired us across the flats. Finally we started up the Chuckanut Drive. To our great surprise we encountered Roger and Sharon Street and Bob LePage, doing a rolling secret control of the various Fleche teams. This was a fleche first for all those on our team. They signed our control cards, we joked a bit, bit adieus until the morning, and huffed and puffed over the Chuckanut into Bellingham. We arrived at the Motel Six (another fleche tradition) at 8:30 p.m. and were pampered by Bonnie and Nicole with a dinner from the Supermarket Formerly Known as Haggens. Then we hit that sack at 9:45 p.m., sleeping until the alarm went off at midnight! Ouch!! More fine dining, in the Nicole and Bonnie cafeteria. Then we gathered for our 1:00 a.m., departure. To our surprise it was relatively warm. After wed gone a couple of miles we had to stop to shed clothing. Then we were back on the road and heading east on the Mt. Baker highway. At Highway 9 we turned north, briefly, before taking some quieter (well, o.k., there was no traffic, even on Highway 9, at this time of day) back roads. A few miles from Sumas we spotted flashing lights on the road ahead. We picked up the pace and closed the distance, finally catching up with "Team No Overkill." I had first met two of its members two weeks earlier, while on the SIR 400 km, when they were bringing up the rear of the B.C. Randonneurs 300 km. They had told me they would be here and viola! here they were. Everyone was excited to meet up with another team in these difficult early a.m. hours. Team No Overkill had been up all night. Their "sleeping" destination was Chilliwack, though they weren't optimistic about being able to spend too much time there. Just before the border team Way of All Fleche stopped at the convenience store for some calories. Team No Overkill crossed the border to dine at Tim Hortons. I can not recall an easier border crossing. I don't think the guard asked us ANY questions! After the border the temperature seemed to drop (we were closer to the arctic now!) so we stopped to put on a few more clothes. Then we worked our way north and east, again along extremely quiet rural roads. Some time before reaching Vedder Crossing, Greg had his traditional mystery flat. We fixed this and continued on as dawns light and chirping birds greeted the day. At 5:00 a.m. we stopped for our 22nd hour signing of each others control cards. Just after continuing on Greg & Ruth developed another mystery flat. This time we couldn't even confirm that there was a hole in the tube. They put the spare tire on, just for a change of variables, and that was the second and last flat of the ride. Dick had been battling with asthma challenges, in the cool morning air, and he looked as bad as I was starting to feel. Lee and I lapsed into tandem team moaning/whining. The rain was starting, and this probably dampened our spirits slightly. After Chilliwack we followed the Fraser River. We started watching the clock and the odometer and worrying that we wouldn't quite get our minimum distance in by our finish time (7:00 a.m.). This caused the team (well, most of the team) to start to move faster. Lee and I were too busy convincing ourselves that we were suffering to be able to keep up. We were lamenting the rain when I noticed that the cue sheet mentioned wed be heading under a bridge. That meant wed be out of the rain. We stopped under the bridge, both barely feeling well enough to get off the bike. We stood under the bridge, feeling generally kind of bad. Then Ron came back and tried to convince us that we were closer than we had previously thought and therefore could still make it to Harrison Hot Springs by 7:00 a.m. We got back in the saddle and finished at 7:00 a.m. on the button! Deirdre Arscot, this years Fleche Pacifique organizer, greeted us at one of the cabins that was part of the Harrison Hot Springs Hotel complex. We were treated to hot coffee and muffins. We sprawled on the floor for a few minutes before other teams started arriving. Then Nicole and Bonnie arrived and we waddled to the Harrison Hot Springs hotel for a nice, long soak in the hot springs. We slowly rejoined the human race, feeling life return to our limbs and chatting with our Canadian cronies. Then it was on to the dining room of the Harrison Hot Springs Hotel, there to again join with our Canadian cronies, this time for eating and more conversation. A young fellow seated next to me asked me to place a bandage on his scraped elbow. He explained that he had crashed, two hours into the ride, but finished anyway. Then he told me he'd done 461 kilometers! After the dining was over we all convened in the lobby outside of the dining area for the awards. Roger Street was master of ceremonies and did a great job of ribbing most parties involved. This year there were four awards given the usual three, and a new one (in this case, a bottle of wine) for the team that was the easiest on the administrators. With my sloppy route sheet, I knew wed never win, and I was right! I'm at a loss to recall who won what categories, except for the following: The distance trophy went to a team that included Manfred Kuchenmueller, Real Prefontaine, a third person whose name I forget and the rookie who had been seated next to me at the banquet. The team that won the trophy for the widest age range had a 19 year old guy with them! This seemed like child abuse, but I said nothing! Notable absences from the ride, though present at the banquet, were Gord Cook, recovering from recent gall bladder surgery, and Karen Smith, in crutches, suffering from the aftermath of a ride with too tight booties. Let that be a warning to you make sure your booties fit properly! After the awards everyone hung around for a while, exchanging more pleasantries. I spoke more with Sean and Barb, from Team No Overkill. As it turned out, they only had 15 minutes at their sleep point, Chilliwack. Sean opted for a shower, while Barb went for the chance to lay down and put her feet up. "So many decisions, so little time" never rung truer! Then people slowly departed, so ending the fleche experience for another year. Its always a bit sad to have it over so soon (well, except for the first 24 hours part). Greg, Ruth, Bonnie and Nicole were sensible enough to stay to spend the night at the Harrison Hotel. The rest of us were hungry for more road time, so we made the drive back

<h3><a name="V4I5A10">Olympic 600 km Preride summary and Tips</a>
<br><br>
Olympic Peninsula 600 km Brevet

The ride started out fine with no problems, even though I had just gotten off work at 4am. I met Ken at the ferry terminal under overcast skies and temperatures in the mid 40s. As we made it across to Bremerton, I was anxious to ride some of the section I was not familiar with, i.e. route 112 and the LaPush excursion. Traffic along route to the Hoods Canal Bridge was light and the shoulder was wide and clean. I cant say the same for the bridge, as it is not one user friendliest around. Be careful for the glass along both directions. 
The cloud cover is starting to burn off as we climb the hills towards Hwy 101. Both Ken and I are hoping for nice weather for a change. It is very nice to have a wide and clean shoulder to ride on for a change. We make our 1st stop at Sequim for water and strip off some of our clothing as the as the sun has come out of hibernation  what a welcome site! As we are rolling out of town Ken breaks a spoke on his front wheel the 1st of several to come that would slow us down. Fortunately,  the wheel was not that far out of round, so we continue onward. Another (2) spokes break  ~ 5miles down the road. What happening here? Is Murphy trying to tell us something?. Thank goodness Port Angeles is only 10 miles down the road. We limp into PA and head for the Bike shop. One hour later, and only few dollars lighter in Kens pocket, he has a finely tuned front wheel. 
There are many little hills to climb as we leave PA towards 112 and the coast. I have always wanted to go on Hwy 112 and now I am doing itand am I going to pay for it? The answer was no as Hwy 112, narrow at times, is biker friendly and offers some beautiful scenery, not to mention little traffic. You do some climbing, as it navigates back and forth over the ridge. We loose site of the water as we head inland past the 3-house town of Pysht to intersect with hwy 113. The nice ocean views come back as we ride into Callam Bay and ride along the water edge all the way to Sekui. This is what I call riding. Of course I can do without the head wind that is prevalent along the coast. Only a little further to our next control at Rays Chevron. One not of importance The store closes up at 9p, so get there early! 
The realization that our Port Angeles rest stop is a long way is starting to sink in. Having no sleep since 12 noon yesterday is catching up with mealong with the thoughts of having to do another 200 km before resting. The weather is starting to turn on us with clouds and a few sprinkles as we back track our way out Hwy 113 to LaPush. We make it to the intersection of Hwy 101 and Hwy 110 and decide to eat dinner at the restaurant on the corner (The Smokehouse). We arrive at 9p just as they we closing up. So if you want some great food, eat here but you arrive before 9p. On the bikes again at 9:45p, on our way to LaPush. I had hoped to ride the route in the daylight but The road into LaPush is nice with very little traffic. Unfortunately once we got to the waters edge all we could do was listening to the waves crash against the shore. {Greg, you should have a great time down there.}. On the way out, my body said that was enough, as there was no way I was going to PA on no sleep for 36+ hrs. We got a motel in Forks and Sleep for 6 hrs. {This was the best 6 hr rest Ive had in a long time.} I do not recommend this stopover to anyone as it makes your second day a challenging one (180+ miles to finish).
 We started out the next morning to rain in Forks. This is normal for Forks as it as the weather changes from minute to minute. The route back to PA on hwy 101 is a flatter course without the strong headwinds. If Ken hadnt lost (2) more spokes it would have been a fast ride home. For 10 miles we skirted the edges of Crescent Lake and its splendor set against the hills surrounding it. The road around the lake is fine condition  with a few patches of grooved roadway mixed in. Riding into PA I become more concerned about the Quilcene checkpoint time with the current pace we are riding. Ken Assures me that we have plenty of time and not to worry, but not wanting to repeat the ride I speed up and ride alone to Quilcene. I make good time averaging over 20+ mph from PA to Quilcene. I turns out Ken was right and we had plenty of time. Oh well, it was still good exercise. (This is a place, if you need, to make up time you can, as the hills are small and the flats are long.
 Leaving Quilcene We traveled on another road I had never ridden on before, The Center road to Chinacum. This is a nice road except for loads of broken glass in the first 2 miles. Be careful and ride as close to the fog line as you can. The trip to Port Townsend was uneventful as traffic into town was sparse, but on the way back it was another story. It looked like the whole town was packing up and leaving. Riders take note if you are around here during the afternoon on Sunday. We crossed the Hoods Canal bridge around ~5:30p, which is the wrong time. Traffic was heavy and as you know very little shoulder room. Please use common sense in crossing the bridge during peak traffic times and wait until you have an opening in the traffic. Once across the bridge Mother Nature decided to pay us a visit with the lovely liquid stuff. Whats a ride without a downpour? We all should be use to a riding in the rain nowwe would ride the rest of the route in the rain. Mother nature did surprise us though, with a whale exhibit crossing into Bainbridge Island. They definitely are a fun mammal to watch! We finally finished at the ride at 8p covering 380 miles in just over 36 hours. All in all it was a fun-challenging ride Im ready to do it againjust kidding!  

Since this is a challenging ride even without Mother Nature, I am listing some tips below that if followed will help you finish the ride in the time allowed.

1.	Tune-up your bike  Lube the chain, check the tires, tighten up loose parts.
2.	Pack enough water for 40 mile stretches w/o service.
3.	Bring extra tire, tubes, air pump, and tools for you to be self-sufficient.
4.	Limit your time off the bike especially at controls.
5.	While on Hwy 112 / 113 pair up with someone / group.
6.	Plan on your rest stop being in Port Angeles  There will be (3) rooms in PA for your convenience.
7.	Use the (2) bags drops offered for this ride; LaPush and Port Angeles (homeward bound).
8.	Be prepared to do several hours of night riding  Please group up with other riders during the night if possible.
9.	Have fun and enjoy the scenery!!!

Ken Carter and Greg Cox are helping me to put on this 600 km brevet. They will be at various control stops with food, water and encouragement. They will also carry cell phones along with me in case you get into trouble out on the course. 

We will have someone sweep the course during the event to catch any people who DNFed. It is imperative though that you let us know if you have quit the ride. I do not want to have anyone that is not accounted for at the end of the ride. The phone numbers will be on your brevet route sheet. 
Finally, if you need to sleep before the Port Angeles stop, you have only a few choices. You can go to Forks and use one of several local hotels, ride on to Bear Creek (10 miles east of Forks) and try for a room there. From there the next lodging is on Lake Crescent, which I am not familiar with. Please stay at Forks only as a last resort. You will have your work cut out for you the next day (170+ miles).
