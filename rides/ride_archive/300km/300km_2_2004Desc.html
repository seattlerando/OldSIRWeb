<b>Special Instructions:</b> Given the distance to the start location for most riders you may want to consider overnight accomodations for Friday in Packwood.  There are several hotels in town.

<p>
The climb to Baby Shoe Pass is gravel/pack dirt for 7 miles, the descent from Baby Shoe Pass is gravel/pack dirt for 3 miles.  Please use caution.  No wimpy 700-23 race tires or you're asking for trouble.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the SIR Brevet Riders Expectations - see <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">http://www.seattlerandonneur.org/member/SIR_rider_expectations.html </a>
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>

<b>Route Description:</b> This is a new route taking you close to three of Washington's volcanos, Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helen's, and Mt. Adams.  It is a challenging route with lots of climbing and about 10 miles of unpaved roads.  There are few to no services between controls and no cell phone service.  Carry plenty of food and water.  The ride starts in Packwood, heads west to Randle then south into the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  You will climb to Baby Shoe Pass on the west side of Mt. Adams then descend to the small town of Trout Lake.  From Trout Lake you will wind your way north and west to Eagle Cliff on the Lewis River then head north for a long climb on the east side of Mt. St. Helen's to Elk Summit.  From Elk Summit there is a long descent to Randle then east on Highway 12 back to Packwood.  The majority of this ride is in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on small paved roads with very little car traffic and some great views.  This will be a true randonneuring experience!

<b>End of the ride:</b> Hotel Packwood
