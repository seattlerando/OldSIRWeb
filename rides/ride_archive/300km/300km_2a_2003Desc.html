<b>Special Instructions:</b>
<p>
There will be an SIR staffed van on Blewett Pass all day.
<p>
The finish may not be manned for early finishers - please leave your control card at the Super 8.
<p>
There is one 24-Hour restaurant in Ellensburg - the truck stop at Exit 109. There is a Super One Foods also open 24 Hours. Most other restaurants close around 10-11pm. I'll have food available for those that finish after restaurants close.
<p>
Please email with any questions about routes or services.
<p>
<b>Equipment needed:</b> Most all riders will be finishing in the dark, so bring enough lighting for the front and rear to be seen from both directions. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders.
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group.
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
