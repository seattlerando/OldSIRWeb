<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>400K Pre-ride Notes</B></P>
<P>Brad and Jeff Tilden, Peter McKay, Mark Thomas and I did the 400K
pre-ride last Saturday.  Many randonneurs feel that the 400K is the
most difficult brevet of the series, and the steady rain and low 40's
temperature that greeted us at 5am wasn't going to make it any
easier.  But we persevered and ended up having a great ride.  There
are some very pretty sections on the ride.  The road up Skate Creek
from Packwood stand out in my mind. The scenery there offers a nice
diversion for the 12 mile climb... We measured 11,000 ft of climbing
on the ride. Since this is a new route, I wanted to add some notes to
prepare people for the ride.  Hope to see you there on Saturday!</P>
<P><B>Route Changes</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The road construction on Orville
Rd between Kapowsin and SR 161 that we encountered on the 200K is
pretty much complete, but the temporary patches are very rough only
on the southbound side of the road.  To avoid this, we will continue
<B>straight</B> at the blinking light in Kapowsin for 3 miles before
making a left on SR 161 to Eatonville. The return leg will use the
200K route, and turn right onto Orville Rd  E., 1.4 miles outside of
Eatonville.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The road to Bear Meadow is still
closed by snow, so the control was moved in by 4.4 miles to Wakepish,
just past the junction of FR 25 and FR 99.  We saw a fox, an elk, and
probably only 5 cars on the ride up to Wakepish and back.</P>
<P><B>Support</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">We will have SIR &ndash; staffed
controls at Wakepish and Longmire with some food and water. Riders
will be able to stop at Randle both before and after the climb to the
Wakepish control, which closes at 5pm.  </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The Texaco in Packwood (control closes
at 9pm) is well stocked and has a Subway that is open until 8pm.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">After Longmire, riders should consider
stopping at the stores in Ashford (94 km from the finish) or
Eatonville (50 km) to make sure they have enough supplies to finish. 
The Ashford General Store closes at  10pm, while the 76 station on
the far side of town closes at 10:30.  Brad and Jeff left Longmire at
9:45 and made it to the 76 station just before closing.  
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The market in Eatonville closes
at 11pm. Peter, Mark and I left Longmire at 8:15, and with some
strong pulls (or was it the downhill?) made it to Eaton</SPAN>ville
by 10:30.  After 11pm, there will be an SIR volunteer in the market
parking lot with some food and water.</P>
<P><B>Tracks</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The railroad tracks on SR 7 just west
of Elbe are treacherous, especially in the rain.  We knew they were
bad and still managed to crash going over them.  We walked over them
on the way back, and found it less painful.  Also, there are 3 sets
of tracks between Ashford and Elbe, but they cross the road a better
angle.</P>
