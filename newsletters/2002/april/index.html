<p>
<blockquote>
Saturday dawned cold - clear, yes, but cold.  Still, I needed the miles and it would be nice to ride with others for a change so I bundled the Heron up and headed off for the hour+ drive to Woodinville.  Unfortunately I didn't head out quite soon enough so I didn't have time after arriving to get to talk with much of anyone else.  I did see Peg and we talked while I got things ready - she's quite a bit faster than I am so it was going to be the only chance I'd have to say hello.
</p>

<p align="left">
The sun appeared to bring riders out of the woodwork.  Here it was, Bike Expo weekend and people were actually going to go for a ride instead of wandering around the Expo.  What were they thinking of?  What was I thinking of?  I knew that the ride had also been listed as a Cascade club ride but I had no idea there would be this many people out here in early March.
</p>

<p align="left">
At about 9 o'clock Mark sent us off in a couple of waves.  At least that was the theory - it looked like a pretty much continuous line of cyclists from where I was riding.  A ridiculously short warmup brought us to the first of the days hills.  Not a particularly bad hill but I've never done well climbing before I've had a chance to warm up.  Scratch that, I've never *before* done well climbing before I've had a chance to warm up.  One of the things that I've changed on my bike since the last time that I rode this route was to go to shorter cranks and, now that I think about it, I don't think that I've had a problem warming up since.  It's not like I'm going to be mistaken for someone who can climb but since I'm going to be slow it's nice to be comfortable.
</p>

<p align="left">
At this point I decided on a strategy that would serve me well all day - find someone who isn't going at a pace too much faster than I would be comfortable with and follow them.  I didn't know any of the riders that I was following but one bike stood out - a dark gold or maybe light orange Rivendell.  I'd see that bike again before the end of the day.  The one problem with following is that you tend to forget to look at your route sheet.  Oh well, it was only a mile excursion - each way.  After that I kept an eye on the route.
</p>

<p align="left">
Up, down, over and probably around we went.  One short steep hill that I remembered from last time.  Didn't seem as steep this year for some reason.  A chance to say a brief hello to Bill Dussler, who appeared to be shepherding one or more riders, then off to Woodinville-Duvall road.  At this point I ended up behind a couple that I'd end up following for something like 5 or 6 miles.  One of these days I've got to start introducing myself and learning other peoples names but I didn't so I didn't find out their names (Trent and Melinda) until a couple of days after the ride.  At the turn off from Snoqualmie Valley road to Novelty Hill road someone decided that he just had to go up that road - only stopping from running Melinda over at the last second.  Seems that the sun also brought out some lousy drivers.  Shortly after that I decided to pick up my pace a little and went around Trent and Melinda to follow Mark Thomas who'd come buzzing by riding with someone whom I didn't recognize on a Kestrel.
</p>

<p align="left">
Not that I had any hope of catching Mark.  Mark and friend disappeared into the distance while I rode along the flat, agricultural, Snoqualmie valley.  The sun was shining, it had warmed up some, there was no traffic, the wind wasn't in my face (I would find out later that it was at my back.)  I enjoyed this section of the ride immensely.
</p>

<p align="left">
A quick stop at Sandy's for some salties and I was ready to head off for the falls.  As I was getting ready to leave a young lady asked if I knew the route and if so could she tag along.  Not a problem.  When I got a chance to talk to her (on Neal Road) it turned out that she was just 17 and out here training for an AIDS ride back east.  Her training schedule had called for her to do a 40 mile ride that day but she thought that the 100 km sounded like a nicer ride - I'm not sure what she thought of it later in the day as she dropped me going up to the falls and passed me again later in the day.
</p>

<p align="left">
After a quick stop at the falls it was time to head back north.  Following a by now familiar looking Rivendell.  At least until we got to the bottom of the hill when I found that we'd had a very slight tail wind all of the way up from Woodinville.  Oh well, nothing's perfect.  Thankfully it was a very slight head wind and I was still feeling fine.  Back through Carnation, back along the valley, but unfortunately not back along the valley far enough.  Someone had decided that the route back would go up Union Hill road.
</p>

<p align="left">
This wasn't the first time that I'd ridden Union Hill road and each time I ride it I swear to myself that it will be the last (several people that I spoke with on the route also swore, sometimes quite vehemently, that it would be their last time riding that road) but I keep coming back.  Probably a character flaw.  This time I just concentrated on not working too hard, drinking plenty and working on my spinning - or to be more correct, my twiddling.  Slowly, very slowly, I caught up with another rider.  This is so unusual as to warrant a comment.
</p>

<p align="left">
At the intersection with Redmond-Fall City road I found myself once again behind a gentleman on gold Rivendell.  Somewhere earlier in the ride we'd talked a bit about the "fun" parts of this ride and I mentioned that Union Hill was still to come.  Now that we were done with it I asked him how he had liked it.  His remark was that he'd left his quads somewhere back there on the hill.  Funny thing, though, he didn't mention going back to try to find them.
</p>

<p align="left">
All that was left now was the slog, into the wind, along the jam packed Sammamish Bike trail.  I think that I actually stayed below the posted speed limit the entire way back but only by default - at any point it was either too crowded or I just didn't feel like pushing it into the breeze.
</p>

<p align="left">
After the ride I got to talk with some of the faster people (particularly Orin Eman who I'd met on a ride some weeks before) and find that the amount of climbing for the route had been shortchanged in the original write up (it said 2300' but people were coming up with closer to 2900'), but I didn't hang around for long as I still had the drive back to Tacoma waiting for me.  In the days that followed I would find out the first name of the rider on the gold Rivendell (Russell) and the names of the couple that I'd followed earlier in the ride.
</p>

All in all it took me a little less than 5 1/2 hours to finish but I felt pretty good afterward so I'm not worried about having been that slow.  I was treating this more as a testing ride than a training ride - I was hoping to be able to finish this ride and still feel like I would be able to head back out and do it again if needed.  I almost made it.</blockquote>

<b><font size="+3">From Zero to 100 km</font><br>
By Melinda Morrow</b></center><br>
<p>
<blockquote>
Cast your mind back to a time when you were a baby randonneur, when 100 km seemed like a long way.  That's me.  I started biking a year ago after a lifetime of opposition to organized exercise of any kind.  I wanted off the bus and out of the office, the better to enjoy the precious sunny days that Seattle sometimes offers.  Fast-forward a year through three bikes and one wreck, and I had worked my way up to 40 flat miles on the Burke-Gilman, or about 32 hilly miles on Vashon Island (punctuated by stretches of walking up hills and sniveling pathetically).  But there I was, at the start of the Populaire.
</p>

<p align="left">
My husband, Trent Hill, joined SIR last fall after riding Kent Peterson's fall Unpopulaire.  Obviously, he's a glutton for punishment.  He convinced me that this ride wouldn't be nearly as brutal as the Unpopulaire, that I could do it, and that he'd ride with me.  We arrived at the brewery early and nervous.  Since we got lost on our way to Redhook, before the ride ever started, I was a little skeptical about our ability to navigate through unknown territory with a route sheet, especially since I had left my computer at home and wouldn't be able to check mileage.
</p>

<p align="left">
We started with the second wave of riders, and I encouraged Trent to ride ahead as I slowly toiled up the first hill.  I quickly fell to the back of the group, but I had hit my stride (and, yes, my granny gear) and had enough oxygen to chat with Bill (didn't get a last name, but he's a long time SIR) when he caught up to me.  Trent was waiting for me at the next turn (which turned out to be a theme for this ride), and we rode together to the nasty hill across Avondale.  We had the green light, so I sailed through the intersection and up this hill without really stopping to consider the situation.  I've had clipless pedals long enough that I don't fall over anymore, but I'm not exactly smooth about unclipping in low-momentum situations‹like this steep hill.  I started swearing about 50 feet up the hill (my apologies to the residents of Woodinville) because I couldn't stop and I wasn't really sure I could keep going.  Trent and I had our only marital spat of the ride somewhere after this hill ("Left!"  "No, right!"  "Left!"), and I'm gracious enough not to mention who was correct.  
</p>

<p align="left">
We met up with Kenneth Stagg on Old Woodinville-Duvall Rd.  Kenneth had overshot the turn and gone a ways on regular Woodinville-Duvall Rd. before turning back to rejoin the official route, which would, of course, later rejoin regular Woodinville-Duvall Rd. after a few of those "gratuitous hills" that the route sheet mentioned.  Poor Kenneth.  He stayed with us through the first part of the lovely Snoqualmie Valley, and was behind us when I was almost run over by an aggressive pick-up truck driver at the intersection with Novelty Hill Rd.  Trent and Kenneth were much more upset by the truck than I was, because I was too busy feeling grateful that the route didn't include that hill.
</p>

<p align="left">
We met up with Bill again at Sandy's in Carnation.  I had a shot of espresso and a chocolate chip cookie, and we set out with Bill, another first-time SIR rider named Lindsey, and a guy who had gotten off-route and hence was as behind as we were.  Our little group later absorbed another woman (I never got her name) on a beautiful pink Ericsson bike.  On 203, we passed my first chasing dog, a fat hound that Bill expertly squirted with a water bottle.  (Editor's note:  Since I (Trent) was a few yards behind, the fat little dog morphed into Cujo, Jr., by the time I reached him/her/it.  Do hell hounds have a gender, anyway?)
</p>

<p align="left">
The ride up to Snoqualmie Falls wasn't as bad as I expected.  I'm not saying I was going fast‹au contraire‹but when I got to the top I discovered that I had one gear left.  Whoo-hoo! The funniest part of the climb was that as Lindsey and I were slowly oozing up the hill a sports car full of teenage boys went by.  One of the boys hung out the window, flipped us off and screamed "Fuck you!"  I thought, well, I'm panting really slowly up a heavily trafficked road on a bicycle, why wish me more ill?  The real salt in that wound is that when the boys passed Trent, a little ways up the road, they shouted "Rock on, Dude!"  I guess I'll have to learn to climb with more authority to impress the teenagers.
</p>

<p align="left">
We rolled on through the ride, with me getting increasingly tired and achy.  By the time we started up the hills of Carnation Farm Rd., my knees hurt and I was desperately wishing I had used the rest rooms at the Falls.  That combination of woe helped propel me to the junction with Union Hill Rd., where Trent was (once again) waiting for me.  I visited the bushes somewhere along this road, then (once again) encouraged Trent to go ahead of me.  I had a moment on that road where I really thought about quitting.  Everything hurt, I was moving at a glacial pace, and the end of the hill was not in sight.  One of the strange advantages to being the absolute last rider, though, is that no one is going to pass you who might save you.  You have to keep going if you want sympathy.  Bill, Trent, Lindsey, and the other woman were waiting at the top (when I finally got there), and we continued on together.  I had to take one more whining break along the Sammamish River Trail, and we finally rolled back into the Brewery, something like 6 hours after we started.  
</p>

<p align="left">
Despite my physical misery at the end, I'm glad Trent talked me into doing the Populaire.  I did finish, and I didn't have to push my bike up any hills.  That's better than I really expected.  Bless Bill for riding sweep up‹I know he could have ridden the whole route twice in the time it took us, and his pacing and navigation was a huge help.  Trent, wonderful husband that he is, really did stay with me for most of the ride, though every extra minute he spent on the new Brooks saddle that Kent gave him that morning was extra unpleasant.  The beer (carbohydrate replenishment), burgers, and conversation with Lindsey at the Brewery were a perfect ending.   
</p>

I still think the randonneurs are crazy, but I'm considering signing up.  I wish I was in shape for the March 200 km, but I think I'd better wait until August.  Maybe in a few years I'll be able to view the 100 km as a nice pre-season warm-up.  It's hard to believe that now, but a year ago I wouldn't have believed I could finish this ride.

<b><font size="+3">200 km Report</font><br>
By Ken Stagg</b></center><br>
<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
Peg Winczewski pulled up to my house just be 6:00 am, we loaded up my
stuff and we were off to the start of SIR's spring 200 km.  Part way to
Kent I thought of something and looked at my bike through the back
window of Peg's pickup - yep, I'd forgotten my route sheet holder.  Oh
well, I've done this ride twice before so I shouldn't have a problem.
Sure!  On arriving at the start we noticed that there were a lot of
cars there - far more than I was expecting for the years first brevet.
</p>

<p align="left">
After the final instructions from Greg Jan Heine asked us to observe a
moment of silence for Susie Stephens, a bicycle and pedestrian safety
advocate who had been struck and killed by a tour bus in St. Louis the
previous day.  Then 50+ cyclists took off for a 125+ mile ride.
</p>

<p align="left">
Since I had my route sheet in my jersey I was playing follow the
leader - off course, of course.  Fortunately it was a short excursion
and the last one for the day.  Shortly after that we picked up the
Kent-Black Diamond road and were quickly at the first control.  The
bakery was swamped so I settled for getting my card signed and heading
out.  One of the things that I wanted to try on this ride was limiting
the lengths of my stops.
</p>

<p align="left">
The next leg let me test one of my other resolutions for this ride -
take it easy so you have something left at the end of the ride.  I
felt good at the first hills but I still paced myself as if it were
later in the ride (i.e. I twiddled) and didn't bother trying to keep
up with anyone else.  Funny, in my memory the section from
Kent-Kangley road to Hobart was much longer.  I got my card signed,
refilled a waterbottle and headed out toward Enumclaw.
</p>

<p align="left">
While I wasn't trying to ride with anyone on this section I spent
quite a bit of time just behind Ken Krichman and Anne Marie.  I
happened to be just behind Anne Marie when a couple of dogs broke away
from their owners to give her a chase (she outran them easily.)  I was
hoping that the owners would take the hint as there was another rider
coming.  Nope.  The dogs didn't seem to listen to the people at all so
one of them got a face full of Halt! for his troubles.  That did the
trick.  Other than that (and the "secret" control) this section was
uneventful.
</p>

<p align="left">
After a not too long stop at the Enumclaw control it was time for the
harder legs of the ride.  It starts off innocently enough, Mud
Mt. road to 410 to River Ave to SR 162.  Nice and simple. A left onto
Orville Road, though, and it always seems that my legs go away.  This
time, though, I'd thought it through a little further and I realized
that, though the road looks pretty level it is actually climbing
enough that gearing down just a bit would be a good idea.  I didn't
make good time on this section but I got through it without quite the
sense of frustration that I normally encounter here.  I also saw the
Jan heading back the other way.  I know that he's fast but this is the
first time that I'd been passed by a returning rider before Kapowsin!
</p>

<p align="left">
A left at Kapowsin and I was on a slightly lumpy section that seems to
be going generally down hill - I also started to see more riders
headed back - first Ken Carter, then Mark Vande Kamp and then they
started to really stream by.  The miles along the lakes ticked by and
then it was time for the climb up to Eatonville.  On the way up I had
plenty of time to see more riders heading back the other direction.
Lots of time.  Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.  Another quick stop at the
control here and it was my turn to cruise down the hill.  So far, so
good but remember that it seemed that the route toward Eatonville
along the lakes was downhill?  Right, the route back is generally
uphill.  Not much but enough to notice.
</p>

<p align="left">
A right at Kapowsin and I was cruising along the road that I was so
slow going up just over an hour before.  Not that I could actually
make up the time that was lost climbing it but I could try.  Mistake!
I made pretty good time here but it took more out of my legs than I'd
thought so when I get back to SR 162 and I had to go back up along
another river - a nice, gentle road that I normally like - my legs
didn't respond.  Oh well, just keep moving even if it's slowly.
</p>

<p align="left">
At the Texaco at South Prarie I had a longer stop than I had
anticipated while waiting for the bathroom to become available.  I
also munched some pseudo-food and talk a bit with Trent (Hill?) who
was doing his first 200 km riding a beautiful Mercian "King of Mercia".
I eventually managed to get myself back on the road and made an
interesting discovery while climbing the hill back to Buckley - I had
legs again!  I was following a gentleman on a Davidson and thinking
that it was about time to drop it to the granny ring when I took an
inventory of how I was feeling and decided that I didn't need the
third ring here after all.
</p>

<p align="left">
Along the way to and through Buckley I got to chatting with Jeff - the
person on the Davidson - and the miles started to tick by once again.
Back through Enumclaw, down the hill to the Green River (49 mph - not
a personal record but a lot of fun, pity there's a stop sign at the
bottom) and across the river.  Then up the biggest hill on the ride.
This time the granny ring was called for and I used it all of the way
up.  Jeff didn't have one and I winced just thinking of climbing this
without it.  He did fine, though.
</p>

<p align="left">
After that it was easy.  It would have been easier still if I'd had my
route sheet holder as the navigation after crossing Kent-Kangley is
more complex than I can manage to keep in my memory so we had to refer
to the cue sheet several times.  And there was one more dog.  This one
turned out to be very persistent but I was on the outside so I never
get a clear shot at it with the Halt! and we eventually just ended up
outrunning it.
</p>

<p align="left">
In the end my time was 10:55 - a little bit faster than I'd managed
before for this distance but not significantly so.  More importantly I
felt fine.  I'd wanted to finish the ride feeling good enough that I'd
feel comfortable going out and doing another 100 km and I feel confident
that I succeeded.  It would have been nice to have felt capable of
doing another 200 km but that would have been pushing it.

<b><font size="+3">The SIR 200 km</font><br>
a brief ride report by Kent Peterson</b></center><br>
<p>
<blockquote>
One the first day of spring, it was snowing in Seattle but just a couple of days later we had almost perfect weather for the SIR 200 km. I'd been fighting off a cold all week but I felt pretty good for the 42K ride from my house down to Greg Cox's place. There were already quite a few riders getting ready when I pulled up to the registration area at 6:15 AM. The temperature was in the mid-forties and the sky was overcast but it looked like the day was going to shape up into a fine day for riding.
</p>

<p align="left">
A lot of us were decked out in our fancy new blue wool Seattle Randonneurs jerseys and I must admit that we did look smashing and were extremely comfortable. Jan Heine had been the driving force behind getting together a minimum order of the jerseys last fall and they'd finally arrived from Italy a couple of weeks ago. Enough people who'd passed on the initial order of jerseys were now regretting it, so it looks like we'll be putting together another order soon.
</p>

<p align="left">
Cars with bike racks kept pulling up and by the time Greg gave the final pre-ride instructions there were nearly sixty of us ready to go. Jan relayed the sad news that most of us had already heard; pedestrian and cycling activist Susie Stephens had been struck and killed by a tour bus on Thursday while she was crossing a street in St. Louis. Susie, a former director of the Bicycle Alliance of Washington and resident of Winthrop, Washington had been in St. Louis for a transportation conference. As Jan pointed out as he lead us in a moment of silence for Susie, her work and life had been devoted to those of us who walk and ride. 
</p>

<p align="left">
We took off at 7:00 AM with Jan establishing a zippy pace. After we navigated the suburban turns of Greg's neighborhood and crossed onto the Kent-Black Diamond Road, Jan began to pull even further ahead. Guys like Ken Carter and Mark Vande Kamp were also up there. I flipped my computer over from measuring distance to check the average pace. I was averaging over 30 kph at this point and those guys were going faster. I didn't think I was up to keeping a pace like that and as I eased back a bit a few more guys passed me. When I pulled into the bakery at Black Diamond, however, there weren't as many bikes there as I'd expected. Some of the lead guys pulled in a few seconds later, having missed the turn onto Morgan Road. By far the bulk of the riders were still behind us but some people paused only long enough at this control to get their cards stamped while others took a nice break for coffee and baked goods. I grabbed a bottle of juice and took a couple of quick pictures of incoming riders before heading out.
</p>

<p align="left">
One advantage of being on a familiar route is that you don't have to expend any mental energy on navigation. The downside of course is that the ride seems pretty routine. This ride was very familiar to me since we'd used this route for our 200 km for the past couple of years and it's one of my standard training routes. So I kind of locked into autopilot for the ride although I did get to chat with various riders enroute and at the controls. I met Stan Reynolds, a fellow who is new to our club. Stan was riding at about my pace for much of the time and he was curious about some of the longer rides and my equipment choices. Of course, I was riding a fixed gear and Stan was on a normally geared Lemond, so our paces didn't always match and we weren't riding together all the time but we did get to chat quite a bit. I also got to talk real briefly with Danelle Laidlaw at the control at Enumclaw. Danelle confirmed that not only is the Rocky Mountain 1200 full, it's over-booked. She'd been intending on limiting the ride to 50 riders but she already has over 70 registrations. It should be quite a ride.
</p>

<p align="left">
Even though it wasn't a control on the way out, I stopped at the Texaco in South Prairie for a quick hot dog and a pint of milk. Ed Husted expressed the usual dismay at my choice of fuel and introduced me to his friend Patrice Vermillion. Ed and Patrice alleged that this was her first brevet but she sure looked like this stuff came naturally to her. Anybody who can hang with Ed is certainly no slouch as a cyclist.
</p>

<p align="left">
The great thing about the day was that it wasn't windy, it wasn't hot, it wasn't cold and it wasn't raining. Heck it hardly seemed like a real SIR brevet! Wayne would later tell me that I didn't look like I was having a good time. Actually I think I was, but I think I'm actually happier when the weather is a nastier.
</p>

<p align="left">
Unlike last year, the sign pointing to Electron was intact so I don't think anybody missed the turn onto Orville Road. I saw Danelle and John pulled over fixing a flat on the tandem, but they had everything under control so Stan, Ed, Patrice and I rolled on by. Our group kind of broke up on the ride into Kapowsin and after Kapowsin I started seeing the first of the riders returning from Eatonville. Jan Heine and Ken Carter were looking really good and Jan was far enough into the zone that he'd tell me later that he never saw me on Orville Road. But I have witnesses! And a signed control card. I was there, Jan. Honest.
</p>

<p align="left">
I hadn't been looking forward to the climb up to Eatonville and I told Patrice that I fully intended to "weep like a man" when I hit the hill but it wasn't nearly as long or steep as I'd recalled it being. I did get to see Bill Dussler and Mark Vande Kamp descending as I was climbing and I got a real good look at a Rivendell Wooly Warm jersey as I slowly crept past a fellow wearing one on the climb. I was pleased that I still had the breath to ask the owner how he liked it and he replied it was the best thing he'd ever bought from Rivendell. So, wool fans, if you missed out on the SIR wool jerseys (I did mention how smashing they look and how comfy they are, didn't I?) and you don't have the patience to wait for our next order, Rivendell may be the place to get yourself a wool jersey.
</p>

<p align="left">
It was actually getting a little warm and there was some kind of odd yellow light in the sky when I pulled into the bakery at Eatonville. The bakery was actually quite mobbed. I got my control card signed and bought and drank a couple of cartons of milk before heading out. Like a lot of folks, I debated about my clothes and how I should adjust for temperature. I kept my wind vest on over my jersey but I did stow my Possum wool earband. If you're placing that order at Rivendell, take a look at the Possum wool head tube. You'll have to put up with Vande Kamp calling you "Possum Head" but it's a cozy bit of gear for warding off the morning chill.
</p>

<p align="left">
I was happy to see Eric Courtney pull into Eatonville. Last year Eric had been one of the people thwarted by the missing Electron sign and he has a history peppered with various misadventures. It was good to see him having a trouble free ride. 
</p>

<p align="left">
As I retraced down the hill and along Orville Road I got to see the rest of the rando riders. Ken Krichman and Jim Giles were both looking like members of some non-motorized chopper gang on their long and low Black Gold Rush recumbents. Of course there were lots of folks I didn't know, but if you ride enough of these rides, you get to know a lot of folks and learn their basic riding styles. While it's always a safe bet to figure Jan is off the front and Bob Magyar is going to be the red lantern, the middle sorts out differently depending on the day. And on this particular Saturday it didn't look like anybody was having too bad a time. I got to wave to lots of my friends.
</p>

<p align="left">
My new pal Stan was ahead of me all the way to South Prairie and he gave me some of his Fritos before he took off from the Texaco. I washed the Fritos and Clif Bar down with a Frappicino and some Orange Sobe. Mark Thomas took off from the Texaco ahead of me, with the prediction that some of us would catch him on the first hill. I took off a couple of minutes later, while Wayne, Tom, Ed, Patrice and some others were still fueling up. Mark was right, I caught and passed him on the climb just north of South Prairie.
</p>

<p align="left">
I cruised back through Buckley and the back roads around Enumclaw. Like the Eatonville climb, the climb out of the Green River Valley wasn't as bad as I'd remembered, while the run back along the Kent-Black Diamond Road was just as zippy as I'd hoped it would be. Frank Cordell caught up with me at the light by Lake Meridian Park and we rode the last part to Greg's together. Actually I think Frank was a bit faster than me for this section, but he had to keep checking the cue sheet while I knew the way so he just let me do the navigation.
</p>

As usual, Greg and family had a good supply of food and beverages on hand for the post ride party. I had some nice chili and rice and lounged around for an hour or so before I headed out for the ride back to Issaquah. My route home backtracked on the course for a bit, so I got to see some of the other riders coming in.

<b><font size="+3">The SIR 300K</font><br>
by Kent Peterson</b></center><br>
<p>
<blockquote>
In the same way that the Inuit are reputed to have something like fifty different words meaning "snow", the Seattle area weather forecasters have at least several dozen different ways of predicting rain. They decorate their reports with all kinds of linguistic obfuscations like the classic "rain turning to showers with a chance of sunbreaks" and "heavy precipitation in the northern convergence zone" but all the words in the world can't mask the fact that the region's reputation for rain isn't exactly undeserved. And as T.S. Eliot noted, "April is the cruelest month." So, while the forecast of "wind and rain" for Saturday April 13th wasn't exactly unexpected, it did denote a certain lack of creative effort on the part of the meteorological community. Either that or they had collectively decided that there was no point in fostering any false hopes for the day. April 13th would contain wind and rain and there was no point trying to hide the fact.</p> 
<p>
I woke at 4:00 AM, pulled on my riding clothes, brewed my morning coffee and looked out at the rain. It wasn't raining hard and south wind was blocked by the reassuring bulks of the Cascade foothills. At 4:30 AM, I rode the 28 kilometers from my warm dry home in Issaquah to the ferry dock in downtown Seattle. I rode out from the shelter of the hills and over Mercer Island, but the wind still wasn't too strong and the rain was gentle. </p> 
<p>
By the time the ferry pulled out at 6:20 AM, a good crowd of randonneurs had shown up for the ride and when the ferry docked in Winslow at 6:50 AM, we joined up with a few more. Bill Dussler gave us the final pre-ride briefing, including a caution about watching the bridge crossings in the wind and at about 7:02 AM we all headed north across Bainbridge Island. Despite the grim forecast, there were nearly 40 people riding this 300K.</p> 
<p>
The really fast folks took off quickly with Jan typically hammering his way off the front. Other strong riders like Ken Carter, Ken Bonner and Ed Husted were also moving at a good clip as was relative newcomer Stan Reynolds. Since we were heading north, the wind was basically in our favor now and as we crossed the Agate Point bridge onto the Kistap Peninsula the skies cleared. I wound up riding much of this early section with Robb Simmons. I first met Robb a few weeks ago on the SIR 200K and to look at us you wouldn't think that we'd ride together too much: I'm small and Robb is big, I'm riding an Eddy Merckx set up as a classic fixed gear while Robb is on a Bianchi with Spinergies, Robb bombs along on the descents while I dance up the climbs. And while we didn't ride at the same pace for hardly any of the ride, the rolling terrain made it so that we'd keep passing and re-passing each other. Robb was having a bit of wheel trouble, but he'd contacted his wife and she'd be delivering his alternate wheels to the first control at Port Hadlock.</p> 
<p>
While the wind hadn't been bad on the Agate Point bridge, the Hood Canal Bridge was a mile of floating concrete laid perpendicular to the wind's fury. As I turned west and I saw some of the faster folks working their way across the bridge. The wind had pounded the water to the south of the bridge into an angry white froth and every minute or so a strong gust would smack a few hundred gallons of seawater across the width of the bridge in a randomly collapsing arc of moisture. We each measured our pedal strokes and our efforts, somehow avoiding the worst of it. Well, most of us did. Later I'd find out that my friend Ken Krichman crashed almost as soon as the front wheel of his recumbent hit the water-slicked bridge deck. Bill Dussler and Ken Stagg had stationed themselves at the bridge and Mark Thomas had been right by Ken when he went down, so even though Ken was out of the ride with a dislocated finger and a torn up elbow that would require stitches, he was in good hands. Ken Stagg transported Ken back to Seattle and when I talked to Krichman the next day he seemed to be in good spirits.</p> 
<p>
Back on the road, those of us who remained were all glad to be past the bridge. At 9:22 AM, I pulled into the Texaco at Port Hadlock. This marked the northernmost point of the ride and now the soon enough we'd be facing the wind. I was surprised to see Jan Heine at the control. While Jan had been characteristically fast, he'd also made one of his typical navigational errors. I was also happy to see Ken Bonner, another fast guy whom I typically only see at the start of rides. This would, of course, turn out to be the last time I'd see Ken today. After drinking down a pint of milk and munching a Clif Bar, I headed south.</p> 
<p>
From Port Hadlock to Quilcene the route is mostly sheltered from the wind, but the chipseal road is legendary for it's slowness. Today it didn't bother me much and I rode part of this section with Wayne Methner and Pete Liekkio. When we got into Quilcene, we stopped again to refuel. It was here that we got the word about Ken's crash from Mark Thomas and Terry Zmrhal. Both Mark and Terry had ridden the pre-ride last week. Terry was just out for a "fun ride" and would be heading back to the bridge from Quilcene, while Mark Thomas had skipped the northern leg after having a couple of flats and characterized what he was doing now as "just some riding with friends". Fellow fixed gear riders Jon Muellner  and Tom Brett also pulled into Quilcene before I headed south for the gentle climb up Walker Pass.</p> 
<p>
After cresting Walker Pass, we again had to face the strong south wind. I was mostly riding by myself for this section but never to far from Wayne, Mark, Pete, Jon or Tom. Most of us wound up stopping at Eldon, but Jon motored on while the rest of us were munching as did a few other riders.</p> 
<p>
The wind was draining, dropping my average from it's earlier 27 kph down to 24 kph, but the Eldon break proved to be refreshing. I was feeling pretty good when I pulled into Hoodsport at 1:25 PM. Our sunshine was evaporating and off to the east the skies didn't look good. The turn onto 106 again put the wind at my back and this proved to be another 27 kph section. I rolled past Wayne, Pete, and Mark who where stopped helping Jan. I shouted out a quick query to make sure they were OK and when I got the standard assurance, I rolled on. I'd later find out that Jan had blown out a big section of his tire and lacking a spare, he'd had to wait until somebody else showed up with a tire that would fit.</p>
<p>
Tom Brett was right behind me as we pulled into the QFC in Belfair at 3:15PM. I had a lovely latte and a couple of coconut macaroons, one of which I saved for later. It was beginning to rain so I zipped the sleeves back onto my jacket/vest and after making sure my bottles were topped out, I headed back onto the road. On North Shore Road I passed Jon Muellner who was pulling on his rain gear.</p> 
<p>
I pulled into the control at Kay's Corner at 4:27 PM. This control consisted of Bill Dussler and his parked car, but Jan was there taking advantage of the food, comfort and conversation offered by the control. I paused just long enough to get my card signed and steel my resolve for the hills ahead. Jan was as low as I've ever seen him, repeating how this wasn't a good day, questioning the distance, the weather, the sport and the wisdom of continuing. This was so uncharacteristic of Jan, a man who normally knocks these rides off with an apparently effortless nonchalance. But as he pointed out, this wasn't his day. On the other hand, I was having a good day. I've concluded that one of the main appeals of the sport for me lies in pushing against the limits. A hilly 300K course with wind and rain? Bring it on. How about if I ride it on a fixed gear just to keep things interesting? Jon Muellner pulled in just as I was pulling out. Jan looked like he was still going to spend some time considering his options. </p> 
<p>
Fortunately this year the 300K takes a right turn to go along the Tahuya River Road instead of staying left on the wicked Belfair-Tahuya Road. Mark Vande Kamp, Jon Muellner and I had been out here a couple of weeks ago on our fixed gears and that left fork was still vividly impressed on our thighs and backs. Mark who'd done the 300K pre-ride last week assured me that the Tahuya River Road, while still hilly, is "about 1/100th as hard as the left fork." As I climbed those now gentle seeming hills along the Tahuya River Road, I realized that he was right.</p> 
<p>
Another person who'd been right was whoever it was who'd written that "wind and rain" forecast. I'd seen plenty of the wind so far and now the rain part was in full force. It was pouring down. My bike computer decided that we were going 99 kilometers per hour, then that we were going zero kilometers per hour and finally it decided that we were obviously on a submarine and we were cruising at 24 fathoms. OK, maybe I decided that last part after my computer just gave up in disgust. Unlike my computer, I was still feeling fine. I was extremely wet, but I was fine.</p> 
<p>
I dove down to Dewatto, climbed a whole lot of very wet hills and eventually turned onto the Seabeck-Holly Road. I know the Seabeck-Holly Road very well and it features a large hill with a dog that lives at the base of the hill. Often, the dog is restrained and even when he's not, he's only curious and territorial. Still, I'd often looked at the Old Holly Hill Road as it arcs off to the left and wondered "is that any better?". I know that the old road joins the Seabeck-Holly road at the top of the hill, so it at least has the potential to be a preferred route, in the same way that the Tahuya River Road is better than the Belfair-Tahuya Road. A few weeks ago on our exploratory trip Jon, Mark and I took the old road, the road less traveled by, to see if it made a difference. It did. It's worse. It's a bigger hill and it features two dogs. And it's longer. We actually wound up climbing above the crest of the Seabeck-Holly Road and having to descend to rejoin it. So, armed with that hard-won knowledge, I pushed up the Seabeck-Holly Road in the rain. The dog was restrained and watched me from the deck of his cabin.</p> 
<p>
And when I say I pushed up the Seabeck-Holly Road, I mean I pushed. I've ridden this whole course on a 42*16 fixed gear without ever walking but as I was creeping up the hill, I remembered that I still had a macaroon in my handlebar bag. And I was really hungry. So I walked and munched and pushed my bike up the steepest part of Holly hill. When I finished the macaroon, I hopped frog-like onto the saddle and rolled up the rest of the hill.</p> 
<p>
I slogged into Seabeck at 6:45 PM. The latte stand was closed but the store was open and I got my card signed and I microwaved a turkey and cheese sandwich which was delicious. Jan pulled in a few minutes after I did, and was surprised I was taking off again so quickly, but I told him I couldn't bear to stand around and get cold. I put on my reflective sash, turned on my lights and headed out at 6:52 PM. I knew right then that Jan would make it in and figured he'd catch and pass me somewhere before Bainbridge Island.</p>
<p>
I again did my walk and eat trick with some soggy Hershey nuggets on the steep early climb on Anderson Hill road and then spun down and up middle section of that monster. Two weeks ago Jon, Mark and I had taken this hill in the reverse direction on the fixers and none of us had walked. In retrospect, none of us can figure out how we did it. Anderson Hill Road is better tackled with ropes and pitons instead of fixed gear bicycles.</p> 
<p>
After Anderson Hill Road, it was all easy. Sure it was raining, sure it was dark but the wind had died down somewhat and I was past the hills. I rolled onto SR3, into Poulsbo and at 8:50 PM, Ken Stagg was signing my control card in the parking lot at Winslow. Jan pulled in five minutes later. Ken told us that we were the fifth and sixth riders in with Ken Carter, Ed Husted, Stan Reynolds and Ken Bonner finishing in time to catch the previous ferry. Jan and I expressed our sympathies to all those riders still out on the course. We were very glad to be done. </p> 
<p> 
We ate some potato chips and then warmed up in the ferry waiting area until the next ferry which pulled out around 9:20 PM. I had a cheeseburger and a latte on the ferry. A bit before 10:00 PM the ferry docked in Seattle and Jan and I went our separate ways. He rode home to Ballard and I rode back to Issaquah. On Newport, the rain redoubled it's efforts and when I got home at 11:30 PM, I poured half and inch of water out of my shoes and two inches out of my handlebar bag.</p></font>

<blockquote>
The 2002 Fl&#232;che Northwest was a wonderful success and three teams stepped up to the challenge: <b>Rando Renegades</b> (Andy Fuller, Ed Husted, Bob Brudvik, Ken Carter); <b>Sins of the Fl&#232;che</b> (Pete Liekkio, Peter McKay, Wayne Methner, Mark Thomas); and the <b>Shiftless Bums</b> (Kent Peterson, Mark VandeKamp, Tom Brett, Jon Muellner). A big thanks to Peter McKay for putting it all together. The destination was again Resort Semiahmoo in Blaine, Washington and held the weekend of April 26th-28th, with a fine banquet brunch on Sunday morning. Here's a few stories of each team's adventures. 
<p>
<b>Rando Renegades</b><br>
Submitted by Ken Carter
<p>
Using previous Fl&#232;che routes, the Rando Renegades course started at Andy
Fullers' house in Bellevue at 7:00pm Friday. A rain storm had already passed
over most of Puget Sound and left the roads wet with overcast skies. The
route went out thru Marymoor park to Fall City, then North on SR-203 to
Sultan, West on SR-2 to Snohomish, North on Machias to Granite Falls, North
West to Arlington, Stanwood, with headwinds going into Anacortes. Then East
to Concrete via Bow Hill road & F and S Grade road to Sedro Woolley.
<p>
We had breakfast at Concrete with warm sunshine for the first time in the ride.
Then headwinds back to Sedro Woolley, North to Maple Falls, a beautiful
descent in to Sumas from Reese Hill road. Westward Ho onto Mt Baker Highway
to Bellingham and finally North towards Semiahmoo where we ran out of time
just 7 miles from the finish.

<b>Rando Renegades 2</b><br>
Submittee by Ed Husted
<p>
<P>Having completed a Fleche in 2000 with several friends from the &quot;Show me State&quot;, I thought I had a good idea of what to expect this year.  My riding partners for the 2000 Fleche were Jen Flenner, new that year to Randonneuring and stronger than most men I ride with, Arjuna Flenner, who thought this little 365 k ride was just training, and Dale Brigham, 99 PBP finisher and the evil man who coerced me into riding Brevets.  We had a very reasonable route through some of the prettiest parts of Missouri and lots of support, given by my wife, Melissa and Dale&#146;s wife Jo.  I recall great sandwiches, lots of good drinks, and at our hotel, beer.  We stayed at a hotel for four hours that night, and got a little sleep.  My last memory of the 2000 Fleche was the rain and wind we had on the second day as we rode into our last checkpoint.  All in all one of the best rides I had ever done.  But the wind and rain never left my memory; it had though faded to just a little inconvenience.</p>

<p align="left">Having moved to the great wet Northwest, maybe the rain just had not been to bad, in 2000, maybe I was just soft, maybe it was not that windy, or maybe it was an omen of my next Fleche.  I volunteered to ride a Fleche with any of the teams riding this year, and must say I was very pleased to have found such a strong team willing to allow me to draft.  Ken Carter, Andy Fuller, and Bob Brudvik, are a strong group of riders and it was decided a long course was appropriate.  Me, I was just hoping not to die somewhere along the way.  After some correspondence, a route was determined and emailed to me.  520 kms, egad, well as long as it is sunny and not windy 520 is a wonderful distance.  Just long enough to make me suffer; yet not so long that it feels unreasonable.</p>

<p align="left">We all met at Andy&#146;s apartment, and Ken and I went to get some food, and Bob and Andy showed up shortly thereafter.  This Bob guy, I had heard his name, but did not recognize him until later.  He put on all his riding clothes and helmet and all of a sudden I knew him.  Odd how things work that way.  Well, Ken gave us some pre-ride gifts and we began to go outside to ride.  We gave Russ, Ken&#146;s dad, some items for support, and had some photos taken, and left, in the wind and the mist.</p>

<p align="left">From here my memory becomes vague.  Mostly swallowing road grime, feeling headwind, sitting behind Ken, Andy and Bob thinking my legs should feel better, at least until Granite Falls.  There is a McDonalds there, the world&#146;s worst food, but I crave that stuff.  We pull in after a harrowing stretch of highway, or was that on the way to Sultan, hey it was a blur then and still is, me with thoughts of fries and McNuggets.  Oh no, McDonalds was closed.  Oh well, there  is lots of better food to eat.</p>

<p align="left">After Mt. Vernon I recall a very nice section of the ride, it seems to me that we saw very few cars and had most of the road to ourselves.  We talked a bit during this time, and I learned some cool things about my team.  We rode to Anacortes with no problem, save two, the wind seemed to be against us all the time, and the rode spray blew at us non-stop.  Looking back now with a week or so to think about how bad it was, I still think that some cosmic power hated me, and all those who dare ride with me must pay as well.  The wind just would not quit.  We left Anacortes a little behind schedule, but not bad we would still finish with no problem so we decided to pull into a Texaco to grab a few minutes sleep.  We spent about half an hour there, and got back under way, just in time for the sun to rise over us cheering me up a lot, and I guess everyone else as well.  This was my last cheer for some time.</p>

<p align="left">We turned north onto Market and into the wind again.  The wind blew and blew and blew and, well you get the idea.  I looked forward to Bow Hill, it would have to stop some of that awful noise, and at least a little of the wind.  It did, but cresting the hill the wind was still there.  We then turned onto SR-20 and flew into Concrete.  We were a little behind, still, but hey the worm had turned and we had a great breakfast, flat road, and we all felt good.  The cosmic guy has a bad sense of humor, for when we left there it was again, the wind.  Were did it come from?  Oh well, just ride into it, we have got to finish.</p>

<p align="left">We turned onto SR-9, and had what I think was our last section of tailwind.  We rode and rode for what seemed an eternity, and all felt great, fast and happy.  We came upon SR-542, where we were once more blown backwards by my new friend the wind.  We pulled into Sumas later than expected, me feeling dead, and Andy pointing out that hives had broken out on my face.  Allergies, or just a sign of my impending death?  In Sumas I felt bad, so bad that I could not get food down, or any energy up, and for the first time in any ride, I felt like quitting.  I was holding the team up.  They could finish without me, but Bob, Andy and Ken all told me not to quit, we would finish as team, I will confess I was hoping for a much different answer, like just quit Ed you look bad, not support from my team.  So I struggled to follow these torturers to Andy&#146;s house were we met Andy&#146;s mom and some family members, all of this in a strange haze.  Bob and Andy forcing food on me while I was hoping for death.</p>

<p align="left">
Twenty or so minutes later, I felt better, so good in fact that I was now hoping to live and see my wife and dogs again, hey we might even finish on time.  We flew into Bellingham, but were still behind schedule.  A collective decision was made to ride at a reasonable pace into Semiahoo.  This was cool, the views were awesome, and the pace was easy.  At twenty-four hours we were at 508 kms, 11 k from the end.  We sat down and signed cards, and spoke a bit.  We struggled in the last 11k and finished an hour late.  No worries, it was over, I was happy to be alive, the evil cosmic being had lost, I did live, and next year my faint memories of the Fleche will be one big bonk, three guys who would not let me quit, and wind.  The wind will fade, I will forget the bonk, but the three guys helping me finish will become more vivid as the year goes by.  Thanks again guys, and I&#146;m looking forward to seeing everyone at the SIR 400km.</P>

<b>Sins of the Fl&#232;che</b><br>
Submitted by Mark Thomas
<p align="left">
The "Sins of the Fl&#232;che" team consisted of Pete Liekkio, Peter McKay, Wayne Methner, and Mark Thomas. Our route plan went from the Kingston ferry terminal on the Kitsap Peninsula to Port Angeles via Port Townsend, took the ferry to Victoria, headed up Vancouver Island past Nanaimo, turned around, headed back to Nanaimo, took the ferry to Tsawassen, and then completed the ride on the way to Semiahmoo from Tsawassen. The ferry from Nanaimo would dock at the 22 hour mark and we would complete 25km or more to finish the ride.
</p>
<p align="left">
We met at Pete's house in Shoreline at 11pm on Friday night for the ride down to the Edmonds ferry terminal. Last minute adjustments to our gear were followed by some cyclocross through Pete's neighbors' back yards and then the quick jaunt to the ferry. Riding through a quiet Edmonds with our lights flashing we managed to attract the attention of Edmonds' finest. The local gendarme satisfied himself that we were just nuts, not dangerous, and sent us off with greetings to a relative that worked at Semiahmoo.
</p>
<p align="left">
Our Fl&#232;che route started as the ferry docked in Kingston at 12:15AM Saturday. We had a quick jaunt to the Hood Canal Bridge, where mirabile dictu we had the entire westbound lanes to ourselves. Not a single motorized vehicle passed during our crossing. Once onto the Peninsula, we took the sissy way up to Port Hadlock on Beaver Valley and Chimacum Roads. After a refueling stop at the 24-hour QFC, we headed up to Port Townsend, descending all the way into town to our turnaround point and then returning halfway up the hill to our second 24-hour QFC of the night.
</p>
<p align="left">
A little climbing and descending took us through Discovery Bay and over to Sequim, where flagging energy levels detoured us to - yes, you guessed it - the 24-hour QFC. Fortified by coffee, donuts, and other healthy fare, we pressed on to Port Angeles. We arrived before 7AM and went directly to the ferry terminal hoping that we could get on the boat (scheduled departure 8:20) and snooze. It was not to be, but the ticket attendant gave us the next best thing - her recommendation for the best breakfast in Port Angeles. At the Haven on First Street we waited for them to open and then ate the best breakfast that I've ever had in Port Angeles (I've had 2).
</p>
<p align="left">
Once on the ferry to Victoria we looked for places to snooze. Pete was clever enough to conclude that outside on the deck might offer the best opportunity to dry his wet clothes (from our night of rain, of course - Pete doesn't sweat). Soon we were all on the east-facing starboard deck sleeping in the sun.
</p>
<p align="left">
From the ferry we found our way to highway TC-1, our route north. After missing nearly every light in Victoria and nearly getting flattened by an inattentive driver, we were finally out of town. At various points along the way, a separate bike route detours around the cloverleaves. On one of these, under an overpass, we shed multiple layers of clothing. Rain and 40 degree temperatures overnight on the Olympic Peninsula had yielded to a perfectly gorgeous day on Vancouver Island.
</p>
<p align="left">
Earlier, my teammates had asked whether there was much climbing from Victoria. I had ridded the stretch as part of the Vancouver Island 1000k in 1999, so I informed them that I had remembered a lot of climbing, but it was probably because I had put in 900km at that point. In all probability, I said, there isn't really that much. After stowing our warm clothing, we set out to discover that a heck of a lot of climbing awaited us. (The signs suggesting chains or good winter tires were a frightening clue).
</p>
<p align="left">
Beautiful views out to our right almost made up for the climbing, the often poor shoulder, and the occasional inattentive or inconsiderate driver. After a refueling stop along the way we cruised into Nanaimo at 3:30PM. We asked the nice counter girl at the 7-11 how to get to the ferry to Tsawwassen. She said there was one terminal a couple of blocks away (Departure Bay) and another south of town (Duke Point) and that we could take either one. Our route was set up to the closer one. Indeed Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002 only showed the Departure Bay-Tsawassen ferry.
</p>
<p align="left">
We set off north from Nanaimo to our planned turnaround north of Parksville. We started struggling in earnest along this stretch, suffering from an undersupply of sleep and an oversupply of uphills and headwind. We turned around at 5:45PM, in good shape to return to the ferry no later than about 8:00PM, assuming we could make it back in the same 2:15. In fact, with the wind, we made it back even earlier - around 7:30PM.
</p>
<p align="left">
Along the way back we saw numerous signs that informed us that the Vancouver ferry left from Departure Bay (the closer terminal) and that the Tsawwassen ferry left from Duke Point. This was confirmed by a couple of motorists that Peter consulted. Bolstered however, by the 7-11 girl, my always careful planning, and a "yeah, I think so" from a Walkman-listening, BMX-riding kid, we went straight to Departure Bay, which was on the way anyhow.
</p>
<p align="left">
By now, Dear Reader, you certainly know what's coming. The ticket booth attendant told us that we could get from there to North Vancouver on a 9PM ferry, but that the Tsawwassen ferry would leave at 8:15 from Duke Point. She also opined that it was 20 minutes, at least, by car. My route sheet said that it was 7 miles to the turn-off from the highway to the Duke Point terminal. We had about 40 minutes, so we decided to make a run for it. At this point, Peter informed us that we would have to wait just a bit for him to fix his second flat of the day.
</p>
<p align="left">
With that brief delay we set out in an all-out sprint with energy reserves that we had no idea were there. (Of course, our idea of an all-out sprint would be a recovery ride for Terry Z, but we thought we were hauling.) After exiting toward Duke Point and riding a ways, we saw a demoralizing sight - a sign indicating 6km to the ferry. Undaunted, we continued our time trial, buoyed by the certain knowledge that it was downhill to the ferry. Only on average, it turns out, and a bunch of little ups and downs took a toll. Finally we reached the ticket booth and were greeted by a happy sight - the attendant picking up the phone to call the ferry. We were going to make it.
</p>
<p align="left">
Alas, she hung up the phone and turned a sad face to us. The ferry was too far along to wait. Our Fl&#232;che was in shambles - the next ferry was at 10:45. It was impossible to do 25km between 10:15 (the 22 hour point) and boarding. The ferry would dock at 12:45AM, past the 24 hour point. So we gathered what was left of our wits, ordered a pizza, arranged Tsawwassen to Semiahmoo transportation, and went off in search of horizontal surfaces on which to sleep.
</p>
It was disappointing not to finish, but I had a day of wonderful cycling in great company. We also had hot showers, warm beds, and the Fl&#232;che brunch awaiting. It's never a bad day when you're riding your bicycle!

Saturday morning was overcast with a heavy mist but looked like we had missed the heavy rains that had continued for most of the night. As we had opted to do the event on fixed gear bicycles, we felt compelled to take a photo for posterity and Kent's wife Christine obliged in the early hours after signing our cards. We had heard that gears make you weak. We just couldn't afford that.
<p>
Our route would take us through the bike paths and side roads of Seattle to the ferry terminal and onto Bainbridge Island, then follow the 300 km route over the Hood Canal bridge to Port Hadlock and Port Townsend. From their we took the Keystone ferry to Whidbey and then north on Highway 20 over Deception Pass and onto Highway 9 through La Conner to Arlington. We turned west to Darrington and north to the South Skagit Highway and then preceded east to Sedro Woolley. Getting back on Highway 9 we moved north to Lynden and our 22 hour mark, then east to Blaine and Semiahmoo.
<p>
By the time we made the Bainbridge ferry the weather had cleared and we were looking at a stunning day of sunshine and blue skies. On the way Tom had "first flat" and made a record tire change on the I-90 bridge. We made the ferry before our scheduled one and had time in the bank before the first two hours were up. Good for us!
<p>
<img src="F2002Tulips.jpg" alt="Shiftless Bums" width="350" height="200" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right">The ride to PT was leisurely and we stopped to check out the "camelids" on Big Valley Road, those being the camel and llamas that live there. Our first break was in Port Hadlock with a quick snack and fluids, then onto Port Townsend. We arrived an hour and a half before our 1:15PM ferry and rode in with some friends of mine who were coming back from a morning road ride. We all made our way to Tyler St. Coffeehouse for some clam chowder and beverages, then strolled to the ferry where my wife Carrie and daughter came to visit. 5-year old Peri gave us each a big cookie for energy and, though we were leary of her being a plant for a secret control watching us for outside support, having a little girl hand you a treat seemed worth the risk.
<p>
A little ferry trip and a brief snooze and we were on Whidbey, pedaling up Highway 20 to Deception Pass. It was a nice shoulder and we got there in time for some photo ops that didn't turn out, but we felt like good 'ole tourists anyway. Off on Best Road, which is aptly named for the good surface, we traversed down to La Conner and the gorgeous tulip fields. Here's where I dropped my water bottle while drinking and had a few moments of uncontrollable erratic weaving which nearly took me down...unlike a geared bike, I couldn't stop pedaling to catch the bottle before it hit the ground. Whew.
<p>
We arrived in Arlington around 7:00PM and stopped at the IGC for some much needed food and rest. We procured fried chicken and Dorritos and lots of colored beverages, then sat on the bags of mulch and consumed for the long dark haul ahead. There wouldn't be another stop until Sedro Wooley nearly 100 km  away. As we pulled onto SR-530 to Darrington, the night came on and we had a splendid ride with very little traffic. Our pace was consistent and we all rode in a similar pattern; Kent and Mark and Tom and I in two side-by-side formations which we maintained for most of the evening. It was a quite night and though we had lost some of our time advantage, were still on track. Turning north to the Skagit River the road got rougher and the fatigue set in. I was blathering to Tom about time and distance until he said, "I just can't calculate that stuff right now" and I had to agree. I think I just wanted to stay alert, so I went back to the 100th rendition of the B-52's singing "Quiche Lorraine" which was the constant theme in my head for the entire 24 hours.<img src="F2002Flat2.jpg" alt="Shiftless Bums" width="250" height="180" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="left">
<p>
Heading onto South Skagit Highway the time slowed down and we had the night to ourselves as the moon rode and the klics kept going by. Tom had a rear flat and we stopped for a repair. This was a 2nd one and we encouraged him to take one of our spare tires and replace it just in case. He choose the $3 special and mounted it up and we were on our way. 100 yards later an explosion rocked the night as the tire blew off the rim and shredded the tube...ummm. Things were starting to go hideously wrong. Was it the tire? Tube? Whatever, we were back in the same fix and he put in a new tube. After mounting it seemed the valve would not go through the rim enough to be able to pump it up. Tom says "The stem won't go through the rim...damn these aero rims! I know I took the stem nut off...no, really, I'm sure I did that...what the?...no wait, the nut IS still on the tube..." Much laughter in the dark, and once that great mystery was solved we watched Mark put in a new bulb in his gen light and it was dark...eureka! another mystery solved as he discovered the simple issue of having the bulb in backwards. Ah yes, we were quite on top of things that night.
<p>
<img src="F2002DoneBums.jpg" alt="Shiftless Bums" width="300" height="163" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right"> By this time we have now a negative time count and it's looking like stopping will not occur for quite awhile. My butt was getting tired of sitting so I spent a good deal of time out of the saddle when possible. We pulled into Sedro Woolley about 1:00AM and grabbed some snacks and fluids before heading north on Highway 9. This turned out to be a very nice stretch of road and we made good time to Lynden for our 22-hour mark. At 4:30AM we were just a couple km short of town and marked our cards. Two more hours and we'd be at the resort. I was very tired but felt good riding it out and with the impending daybreak knew that we'd have some atmospheric energy to finish the ride. The sun took a long time to crest the horizon and we were welcomed to Blaine with the call of loons and one short wrong turn before finding the road to Semiahmoo. Fog rolled over the road and the moon still hung in the sky. It was a glorious morning.
<p>
After a stiff short climb over the last hill we dropped down to the resort and pulled in at 6:23AM. Close call but we made it and the only issue was "When is the restaurant going to open?" I felt great joy when the desk person said it was only 10 minutes away...and soon we were sitting back, drinking hot cocas and tea and eating up a storm. Later we all sat in the cushy chairs overlooking the bay and wondering when would be the appropriate time to wake those other teams who were still catching some zzz's in their rooms.
<p>
Within the next half hour, Kent announces that he's not really tired and we're just burning up daylight so he's going to ride home now. We nod in agreement and doze off as he logs another 238 km back to Issaquah. I'm not sure if napping makes you weak, but at that point, I didn't even care...
