AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") </P>
<P align=center><FONT face=arial size=1>IN CONSIDERATION of being permitted to 
participate in any way in Seattle International Randonneurs ("Club") and 
Randonneurs USA ("RUSA") sponsored Bicycling Activities ("Activity"), I, for 
myself, my personal representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin: </P>
<P align=center>1. ACKNOWLEDGE, agree, and represent that I understand the 
nature of the activity and that I am qualified, in good health, and in proper 
physical condition to participate in such Activity. I further agree and warrant 
that if at any time I believe conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately 
discontinue further participation in the Activity. </P>
<P align=center>2. FULLY UNDERSTAND that: (a) the ACTIVITY INVOLVES RISKS AND 
DANGERS OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, PARALYSIS AND 
DEATH ("RISKS"); (b) these Risks and dangers may be caused by my own actions, or 
inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in the Activity, the 
condition in which the Activity takes place, or THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE 
"RELEASEES" NAMED BELOW; (c) there may be OTHER RISKS AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
LOSSES either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this time; and I 
FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES, COSTS, 
AND DAMAGES I incur as a result of my participation in the Activity. </P>
<P align=center>3. HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE the Club, 
RUSA, the LAB, their respective administrators, directors, agents, officers, 
members, volunteers, and employees, other participants, any sponsors, 
advertisers, and, if applicable, owners and lessors of premises on which the 
Activity takes place, (each considered one of the "RELEASEES" herein) FROM ALL 
LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ON MY ACCOUNT CAUSED OR ALLEGED 
TO BE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE "RELEASEES" OR 
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING NEGLIGENT RESCUE OPERATIONS; AND I FURTHER AGREE that if, 
despite this RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY 
AGREEMENT I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim against any of the Releasees, 
I WILL INDEMNIFY, SAVE, AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE RELEASEES from any 
litigation expenses, attorney fees, loss, liability, damage, or cost which any 
may incur as the result of such claim. </P>
<P align=center>I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, 
UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT, AND HAVE 
SIGNED IT FREELY AND WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT OR ASSURANCE OF ANY NATURE AND 
INTEND IT TO BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE 
GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW AND AGREE THAT IF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT
