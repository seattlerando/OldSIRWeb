<b>Route Description:</b> This new route will feature many different views of Mt. Baker, theTwins, Chuckanut Bay, and the Straights of Georgia.  Figure on about 8000 ft of total climbing. Modest by SIR standards. A few short challenging hills, but no epic climbs. There will be some flat farmland cruising and some long rollers.  
<p>
The route begins at Dan Turners house east of Bellingham. We begins with a loop down to Bow/Edison with a beautiful morning ride along Chuckanut back to Bellingham. A few good hills will get the blood pumping. From Bellingham, we'll head east across the Nooksack river to Everson then up South Pass Road to Silver Lake Park. The ride will drop back to Mt. Baker Hwy heading up to Glacier, turn around and back to Slilver Lake. You'll enjoy a nice fast descent of Reese Hill to Sumas. From there you'll cruise along the Border west to Blaine and Birch Bay  back towards Ferndale and the back to the finish.
