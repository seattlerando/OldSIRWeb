it?</b></font>
<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Northwest Crank 
is a cycling festival to meet and ride with your fellow cyclists from 
around the state of Washington and the Northwest for some fine spring 
cycling in Wenatchee. Why should you join us?</font></p>
<ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A 
  chance to meet riders from all over the state and region. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Build 
  your base miles for the summer riding season. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Explore 
  the wonderful roads around Wenatchee. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">All 
  you have to do is eat, sleep, and ride! </font></li>

  <li><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Finally 
  get rid of some of your old bike parts in the White Elephant gift exchange. </font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><font color="#003366" face="Times New Roman" size="3">One of the 
best reasons to join us is to build your spring base miles. There are 
numerous opportunities around the US during the spring to spend a week 
just riding. Most of these training weeks are to the south. Here’s 
your chance to explore your home region and get the same benefits. All 
those extra miles will help you maintain and build your endurance. The 
goal is just to finish each day - as you ride you’ll build strength 
and endurance and in a few weeks you’ll notice an improvement in your 
riding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each day has at several featured rides 
to choose from and these have support.&nbsp; If you choose, you may 
of course ride anywhere you want, self-supported.</font></p>

Don’t miss out on 2008 as the festival grows with more routes (including an adventure series), several contests, and of course more riders!<p>

You can register here(link coming soon).<p>

For an event like this we all want to be out riding and enjoying the roads and the support. That support is critical is making this happen. We would appreciate your help!  Maybe you’d like to take a day off in the middle.  Perhaps a significant other is coming with you and could help for a few hours one day.  Please let us know if you are interested and able to help.  The more help we get, the more successful the event will be for everyone.<p>
