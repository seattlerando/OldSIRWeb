<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Ride account by Greg Cox</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>July saw me in Colorado with my Dad doing the "Tour of
Colorado". So instead of doing Terry’s 600 km I was enjoying some of the
best high mountain (road) cycling I have ever experienced.  I figured
it would be no problem making up the ride, in fact, I targeted the BC 600 km
in August as the most likely candidate.  Well, work got in the way
of that ride so suddenly I was faced with putting on my own 600. 
I had a copy of the BC 600 which started in New Wesmister and headed in
a clock-wise loop through Newhalem, Arlington, Bellingham and points in-between. 
I switched the course around to start in Arlington and to go in the opposite
direction (a task that proved to be pretty difficult.)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Larry Ricker proposed the Fall 600 km tradition in the newsletter
so our date was set for September 12 and 13.  I was a little nervous
about putting on the ride, but I was REALLY nervous about doing the ride. 
I decided to spend the night at the Arlington Motor Inn (the start line)
so that I wouldn't have to get up at 2:30 a.m. to make it in time for the
5:00 a.m. start.  Max had the same idea so I strolled over to the
mini-mart and bought her some nutter butters for good luck.  I hoped
to get a good nights rest, but the butterflies in my stomach had a different
plan.  Just what I needed; a 375 mile ride on no sleep!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 5:00 a.m. start saw Max Maxon, Bob Magyar, Dave Johnson,
Pete "the bullet" Bajema, and myself lining up in the dark and fog. 
Pete and I had agreed to ride together, so I knew this would not be a leisurely
ride.  Our small group headed east on SR 530 to our first control
at Darrington then north to highway 20.  At Rockport we turned right
and rode up to Newhalem.  I spent the night in this little town on
a Cycle America trip several years ago.  I have fond memories of hiking
behind the little dam east of town.  They have the waterfalls and
trails lit with all these funky, colored lights.  Of course there
was only time to get our control cards signed and take care of necessary
business this time before we were blasting down 20 on our way to Sedro
Woolley.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We passed Dave going the other way just outside of town
so he was about fifteen minutes behind us.  Then, a ways farther we
passed Max (hell-bent-for-fury) peddling towards Newhalem.  I tried
to chase her down to tell her that the Sumas border might not be open 24
hours (it was), a fact that Pete brought up on our way to Newhalem (good
timing).  Luckily Bob came along shortly behind Max because I could
not catch her.  We passed the concern on to him and continued down
the road.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Of course, one of the reasons Max was clipping along so
fast was the tail-wind she had which meant Pete and I were facing a head-wind;
yuck!  About 10k outside of Sedro the lack of sleep and food caused
me to really question doing this ride and randonneuring in general. 
I must say that every brevet I have done this year I have had this kind
of negative period.  Each time the lack of food has been the major
culprit in contributing to my foul mood.  If I had been by myself
I would have turned south and dragged tail home.  Luckily, some fuel
at the control point, a call home for some words of encouragement ("What
do you mean quit?!?  I've been bragging to everyone what a stud you
are!"), and a stern look from Pete caused my dark mood to do a complete
180.  We had covered 205K in 7:15, only 400 km to go.  I knew the
pace would not be as fast for the rest of the ride but physically, we both
felt great.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The ride pointed north up highway 9 along roads I had
never been before.  The day was bright and sunny and the sky was the
clearest blue I had ever seen.  We could see the twin sisters peaks
off to the right and all around were beautiful sights and sounds. 
I kept thinking of John Wagner’s statement; "This is quite simply why I
ride a bicycle."  We made a quick stop at Nugents Corner to refuel
and continued on some very nice back roads to the border crossing at Sumas. 
I had never been up to this part of Canada and I was looking forward to
the ride along the Fraiser River.  I figured it would be scenic and
peaceful.  I was dead wrong.  There must be more Harley Davidsons
per capita in BC than there are boats per capita in Seattle.  The
100 km from Mission to New Westminster and back was like riding 100 km along
Aurora ave.  I would not recommend this course without replacing this
section because of the traffic noise and debris on the shoulder. 
The view of Mt. Baker acted like gravity pulling us back home.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>By the time we reached Mission for the second time, my
right knee started hurting in the same way that my left knee hurt last
year; not a good sign.  We peddled through the border and headed to
Pete’s house in Bellingham.  We stumbled into his house to the wary
look of Pete’s wife, Kim.  After a couple hours of shut-eye and a
change of clothes, we were off.  I felt good, thinking the ice bag
and Advil had cured my knee pain.  That lasted until I stood on the
first hill going up Chuckanut drive.  I was relegated to seated climbing
and soft pedaling for the last 150K of the ride.  I guess I picked
the wrong time to switch my 13-28 to a 12-25.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We met up with Dave on Chuckanut who had leap-frogged
us while we rested.  We rode together pretty much until the end of
the ride.  I was quite upset that my knee hurt during this last part
of the ride because it was the hilliest but also because the pain distracted
me from enjoying the beautiful scenery from Oak Harbor through Mt. Vernon
and Stanwood and back to Arlington.  In the end, though, I had enough
steam to sprint the last ¼ mile to make it in under 29 hours; Whew!</FONT>

<CENTER><A NAME="STA"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Something to think about</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The weather for our 1998 brevets was as good as it gets. 
The prediction for next year is grim at best, especially if you remember
back to the wet '97 series.  This is something to think about when
planning for next years training and brevets.  Well maintained equipment,
planning and a proper attitude will serve you well.  Think about using
the buddy system to share in those long soggy rides.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>NW Winter Warning 1998-1999</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob Kraski, Mayor of Arlington and Chairman of the Snohomish
County Emergency Management stated that the coming winter will be the "WORST
WINTER IN 40 to 50 YEARS." This information was clearly reinforced by meteorologist/
climatologist Mike McCallister who shared information collected over time
relating to the water temperature of the equatorial Pacific. The summary
explanation is that the warm water "depository" in the Pacific that moderates
the winters of the Northwest is gone this year.  This will cause the
Jet Stream to rise sharply up the Asian coast, into the Arctic and straight
down toward Washington.  The possibility of error is based on the
fact that there has been 16 consecutive months of record breaking warm
weather and the fact that there is global warming.  However, Mr. McCallister
stated that his prediction of extreme winter is reliable in the 80-90%
range.  He reminded us that in 1916-17 and in 1949-50 there was 6-10
feet of snow accumulation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>WHAT WE CAN EXPECT:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· October - early December: Early heavy snow with
a high potential for warming and flooding.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· Late December - March: High temperatures in
the upper 30's /lows in the upper 20's.  Frequent, heavy snow falls
that will not melt, but accumulate, potentially up to 100"</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· Frequent wind storms in the 50-70 mph range.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· March - April: Spring warming and flooding.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· Potential for prolonged power outages. 
Prolonged periods (weeks or more) of below zero temperatures.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>· The "Arctic express" weather regularly experienced
in Whatcom County could reach as far as Pierce County.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Here are a few excerpts from the book "Against The Wind." 
This book chronographs a transcontinental motorcycle rally which covers
11,000 miles and  must be completed in 11 days. The rally is run very
much like our brevets with controls and time windows.  In the book
the term "Iron Butt Motel" is used liberally to describe napping on your
motorcycle (preferably while stopped.)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not
exist in nature, nor do children of humankind as a whole experience it. 
Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. 
Life is either a daring adventure or it is nothing at all."  Helen
Keller.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>"Carelessness is a self-correcting problem."</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One rider stopped at a gas station during the Texas midday
heat (115 degrees) to apply eye drops to his burning eyes.  He was
standing by the motorcycle trying to apply the drops, but they didn’t seem
to be helping.  Then he realized he hadn’t removed his sunglasses. 
"Drops were streaming off my glasses and onto my leathers," he recalled. 
"I looked up and saw a woman standing there, holding the hand of her son. 
They were staring at me as though I were from Mars, decked out in full
leathers in searing heat while pouring drops on my glasses and laughing
like a jackass."</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a Dark and Stormy Night (metaphor)</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>by John Wagner</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On a clear morning at 4 am, July 18th nineteen randonneurs
cued up at TerryZ's home for the start of this year's SIR 600 km brevet. 
The tough Stevens Pass/N. Cascades route was aborted due to unavailable
motel space in Winthrop.  TerryZ resourcefully came up with what looked
an excellent alternate route by piecing together sections of previous SIR
brevets.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A moderately fast pace and later warm temperatures took
its toll on the way to Rainy Pass (elv. 4855) via Arlington and Rockport
controls.  I became particularly concerned on the upper reaches of
the Rainy climb when after 6 riders passed me and none were descending
from the turn around control atop Rainy.  What was going on, were
they being abducted by space aliens or was I spacing out and missed them? 
When Ron went by, cheater using a triple, he mentioned that Larry had taken
a fall but appeared to be OK.  His ride was finished when the paramedics
took him away for closer observation.  Now Guy, my riding partner,
had to stop and take a long but necessary break from overheating, I continued
on and on and on.  When finally cresting the pass my computer showed
5 miles more than the cue sheet distance and the missing rider mystery
was also solved.  There they were, all of them, sitting in the shade
of Terry's support van canopy in various states of disrepair.  Some
had been hanging out for over an hour trying to gather their faculties
to continue back down this retched hill.  Hwy. 20 is one of our state's
most scenic roads and this section through the Cascade mountains rivals
any thing, anywhere, in my opinion.  Snow covered nine thousand foot
peaks abound.  Mountain lakes, meadows of wild flowers, streams and
water falls line the road that was only just carved out 25 years ago due
to the challenges of the rugged terrain.  Unfortunately not many of
us enjoyed all this natural beauty on today's climb, survival was predominate. 
A tail wind contributed to the struggle, effectively placing the rider
in still air, negating any evaporative cooling effect from the wind. 
Five of us, Rick, Ron, Bill, Eric and myself, set out to battle the headwind
and descent.  The shear rock walls and canyons along parts of the
road causes the wind to swirl around and bang you from all directions. 
This is especially true on the fastest sections (50 mph +), making for
erratic bike handling and more thrills then most riders desire.  I
have experienced the buffeting moving me sideways on numerous occasions
and have yet to enjoy the sensation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Secure at the bottom, another in a long long line of long
breaks was spent at the Newhalem Grocery.  Every thing in the store
looked good so I picked up Yogurt, peanuts, V8 juice, a burrito (they were
out of hot dogs), coke and fresh plums.  Eighteen miles later we stopped
in Marblemount at the Buffalo Run for a real dinner.  Another eighteen
miles and a mandatory stop at the Concrete control was required. 
This was a sleep control and any thought of riding through the night vanished
when we saw the motel beds.  Ken, Randy and Dan decided to push on
but eventually succumb to the demons of sleep depravation by Bellingham. 
We were also informed our intrepid friend Max had to abandoned after blistering
her feet on the Rainy climb.  What a shame, the hardest part was behind
or so we thought.  Standing outside the motel room at 11 pm Melissa
was chewing on a bagel when we noticed a pickup truck next door with three
large (70 lbs size) floppy ear hunting hounds peering out of a big box
with 3 cut out head holes.  The scene looked like a billboard to me. 
Melissa asked if she should feed them a bagel.  I suggested it wasn't
a good idea but she walked over to take a closer look.  Having second
thoughts about befriending the beasts she tossed the bagel into the box. 
A ugly sounding fight erupted shaking the truck and breaking the evening's
serenity.  I half expected the dogs owner to come out and start whopping
on 'em, just because they needed it.  After three hours of deep sleep
we started down the road only to stop at a AM/PM in Sedro Woolley for breakfast
#1.  I cleaned out the hot dog bin and was standing at the front door
waiting to exit as soon as the person on the other side came in. 
It took a while before realizing I was looking at my own reflection.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was now dawn on Sunday and a light drizzle felt good
on our way to Bellingham.  Where 13 hours earlier I was cursing my
way up Rainy Pass now riding was a pure delight.  Making 20 mph up
Route 9, no traffic, chatting with friends and in beautiful farm country. 
This is simply why I ride a bicycle.  It wasn't long before we stopped
at a "Hippie style" restaurant that Melissa suggested in Bellingham for
breakfast #2.  On the way down Chuckanut Dr. I lost contact with our
group when I had to stop and administer first aid to a pain in my butt.
It turned out to be a half dollar size broken blister, ow!  For the
next 125 miles I was never in danger of falling asleep. The slightest shifting
of seat position sent a strong message of "don't do that."  Coincidentally,
a few days prior I read a discussion in UltraCycling between our own Vince
S. and Ken C. about the care of one's derrière on long rides. 
Bag Balm was the central topic.  I use Asso cream, which let me down
for the very first time.  Out came the Bag Balm, even after the fact
it brought some relief.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Down in the Skagit Valley I came across Eric, Pete and
Wayne looking lost and confounded by the confusing route instructions. 
We were following part of an old 300 K brevet in reverse and the street
name was different at each end, local knowledge was required.  Everyone
regrouped within a few miles at the next control for lunch.  We were
now within 5 hours of finishing and everyone seemed to find extra energy. 
Rick's 3 flats were history but a noisy bottom bracket gave yet another
cause for concern.  A final stop at the Granite Falls control for
refueling then onto the wonderful back country rolling lake Rosesiger terrain
used by Rick's 200 K brevet.  At Monroe Melissa took the lead to the
finish.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>What looked fairly easy on paper turned out to be very
demanding and I'm still pondering why.  It wasn't just me, all the
finishing times were slow.  After a shower, pasta and lots of liquid
at Terry's I began feeling more positive about the last 38 hours. 
Most everyone hung around Terry’s kitchen, where the food an drink was,
recounting their experiences before departing.  Hearing the final
three, Ron L., Lynne and Robert (all rookies) were close to finishing I
decided to wait and congratulate them for a difficult job well done.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Thank you Terry for the memories.</FONT>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>600 km Ride Account - by Ken Carter</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The start of the 600 km was the same as the end of the 400 km. 
The 19 starters all paraded out from Terry's house past Paradise Lake road
and then onto Hwy 9 out to Arlington to the Thriftway Store we have all
seen from the classic 200 km route.  It was a surprise to see that the
store was not open, so we signed each others cards and continued on with
the days ride.  I flatted 100 yards from the control and then Rick
Hippe flatted 5 or 6 miles later.  After this slow start we both were
riding out past the Darrington Fire station when sirens started going off. 
As we rode towards Darrington my first thoughts were that I hope the fire
trucks head away from our direction.  It wasn't to be that way. 
The trucks passed us and within 10 minutes we came upon the sight of an
accident.  Larry Ricker had fallen and the emergency vehicles were
called to give him a quick examination.  We stopped and found him
to be conscious and a bit embarrassed over all the commotion as any rider
would be.  The majority of the riders were by now in Darrington or
just leaving.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The sun had finally reached out and burned through the
clouds giving us an opportunity to remove our jackets and enjoy what was
to be a warm and sunny day.  Going through Darrington and then to
Rockport most riders had found a pace to comfortably ride in for the duration
of the day.  The small town stores became havens for buying additional
drinks and ice before the big climb that was to begin just outside of Newhalem. 
It was during this climb that many riders found their limitations to the
heat while doing a strenuous ride uphill for 37 miles.  Many stopped
in the shade on the side of the road to cool down and relax before continuing
up to the scenic mountain pass.  The creeks and rivers that flowed
next to or crossed under the highway were tempting to stop and dip ones
feet into.  I looked at each one and made a mental note that if the
next one was a bit closer with fewer bushes between the road and I, then
it would be the one that would draw me in for a dip.  This exercise
continued all the way up until I changed the game and started telling myself
that it was to close to the top to stop.  Only one or two more corners
to go around and the support vehicle would be out on the shoulder waiting
with ice cold water.  This wasn't a short game at all.  It turned
out to drag on and on as the climbing continued.  More turns to count
as the canyon walls kept appearing on either side of the road.  Only
the sound of motorcycles that seemed to always be accelerating uphill passing
the cars on their way to the other side of the Cascades.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Terry's van was across from the Rainy Pass sign at the
summit with shade and chairs setup welcoming the riders to come and sit. 
Upon reaching the van it wasn't more than 5 minutes when the next rider
came up, Wayne.  And then in unison, riders going solo up the grade
appeared every five or ten minutes.  It was only 15 or 20 minutes
before the riders started leaving and heading downhill to Concrete, where
two motel rooms were waiting for those who wanted to sleep before riding
on to Bellingham for the northern most point on the route.  I decided
to stop and cleanup at the room and then ride on to Bellingham and decide
there whether to continue through the night or rest.  Randy Smith
and Dan Peterson stopped to shower and eat before riding out to Sedro Woolley
and then towards Bellingham.  Wayne, John Wagner and others had planned
on spending an hour or two eating at one of the restaurants between Newhalem
and Concrete.  This was close to the 200 mile point into a 382 mile
ride so it was a good time to refuel at a cool sit down establishment,
preferably on a soft bench seat.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The ride out to Sedro Woolley was mostly flat, cool and
refreshing after having the sun pounding down on the riders all day. 
The check in at the AM/PM in Sedro was somewhat busy with all the traffic
going in and out of the parking lot.  One driver came up and stated
that there was a group of four riders heading this way.  They were
somewhere back between Marblemount and Rockport.  The driver was talking
like he had consumed several drinks prior to coming to the store. 
I noticed he left with an ice cream cone dripping down his front side. 
The route to Bellingham from here was very quiet except for the one car
that drove by right after leaving Sedro.  A group of kids decided
to scare the only rider along the side of the road by shouting loudly while
driving by.  After going ahead a mile or two they then turned around
and drove by very slowly with their headlights off and the emergency lights
flashing.  This seems to be the usual kind of behavior for Sedro Woolley.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The control at Bellingham was deserted except for the
cars parked across the road at a local bar.  The giant food mart next
to it was a good place to use the bathroom and pickup more Gatorade. 
It surprised the store clerks to seeing a rider out at 2:00am riding through
town.  After filling in the clerk about the 600 km Brevet I was on,
I walked out while he shook his head in disbelief.  So goes the life
of a solo brevet rider.  The route through town was straight forward
by looking at a map.  Upon reaching Chuckanut Drive I decided that
the hallucinations my mind was playing on me was enough to stop and sleep
an hour or two.  So after the first attempt at finding a campground
and being told by a passing Park Ranger to go another mile south. 
I finally reach Larrabee State Park and quickly washed and laid down on
the grass for an hours worth of sleep.  Then I decided to go and wash
again and found a more comfortable spot to sleep in the shower stall of
the bathroom.  After another hour I was rested enough to continue
riding south to La Conner.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The turn off of Chuckanut Drive onto Bayview-Edison road
was never found during the early morning hours.  Chuckanut led right
into Burlington where I found a map showing the next control to be about
5 miles due west of town on Hwy 20.  The large Texaco station was
easy to spot and included a deli bar.  After this control point, the
route headed due south outside of La Conner and then southeast along Chilberg
rd, across Fir Island and finally onto Hwy 534 through territory covered
previously by the 200 km.  I was impressed by the good weather that
covered the entire Puget Sound during the weekend.  The evening and
early morning riding was just as pleasant as the daytime conditions. 
Thanks to Terry for a fun route and congratulations to all the finishers
of SIR's 1998 600 km.</FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>by Bill Dussler</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 3<SUP>rd</SUP> edition of the Rocky Mountain 1200
was held July 30 – August 2, 1998. 18 of the 21 starters completed the
ride. Three riders represented SIR: Dave Johnson, Ron Himschoot, and myself.
The route was essentially the same as previous years – a triangular route
out of Kamloops through Jasper and Banff National Parks.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Day one: Kamloops – Jasper (434 km)</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>After the requisite group picture at the 4 am start,
we were off! It was a perfect morning for riding, cool and still, with
an occasional patch of fog. No major hills here - just a river grade with
a few rolling hills. I found my way into a paceline with with some of the
B.C. cyclists, and we began picking up some of the riders ahead of us.
One of the riders was Dave Johnson, riding his mountain bike. When we had
talked the night before, our plans for the ride were similar - to see how
we felt and ride with someone going at a similar pace. As it turned out,
we ended up doing the rest of the ride together.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A standard piece of advice for doing a brevet series is
to not make any equipment changes after the 400 km, so that you are not using
any untested equipment on the longer brevets. Well, I broke that rule by
using a different pair of shoes with new cleats. I had used them on the
last half of the 600 km where they felt fine. After the first control here,
I started noticing a twinge in my left knee. The pain wasn't getting any
worse, but I never had any problems with my left leg before, so I was a
bit concerned. Because I had recently changed the cleats, I was trying
to notice if the cleats felt mis-aligned at all. I did see that my right
foot was a little closer to the crankarm compared to my right, so at the
second control I adjusted the cleat. This seemed to help a bit, but after
a while, things still didn't seem quite right. At our next stop in Valemount,
I made another adjustment to the cleat, and my knee did seem to improve
as the day went on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>By now we were riding in the heat of the day, well into
the 90's, and we were stopping between controls to refill our water bottles.
I was using just two large bottles, so I had to stop more frequently than
the riders w ith camelbacks. We made it to the control at Tete Jaune Cache
around 7 pm, where we had our first helping of the pasta (rigatoni this
time) that would be served at the rest of the controls on the ride.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We were back on our bikes after 45 minutes, and getting
our first close-up look at the mountains. As we followed the Fraser River,
we passed Mt Robson, at 12,972 ft the highest point in the Canadian Rockies.
There wasn't any big climb up to Yellowhead Pass (3747 ft), just a river
grade and a number of stair steps. It was dark when Dave flatted - a slow
leak, and he decided to just pump it up and hope it would last until the
Park entrance, where there were some streetlights that would make it easier
to change the tire. This was one of those rare times when this ploy actually
worked - his tire made it 30 km into Jasper and our stop for the night!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our accommodations were at a church - dining hall upstairs
with sleeping in the room below. After a shower and dinner (meat lasagna)
we went downstairs to sleep. It was tough sleeping, as there was a constant
noise from the room above with riders coming in with their bikes.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Day Two: Jasper – Banff (290 km)</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Up at 3 am, I had my breakfast of bananas and liquid
food (Weight Gainer 2500), and we were on the road by 4. Dave saw some
elk soon after we started, but I was too sleepy to see much of anything.
The scenery on this day was spectacular - peak after peak on both sides
of the valley, with snowfields, glaciers, waterfalls. The river here was
swift and gray with silt from the snowfields. The road on this stretch
was unpleasant, with cracks crossing the road every 10 – 15 ft. The result
of frost heaves, this would go on for 100 km or so. We seemed to be going
slow this morning – it was 150 km to the next control, but it seemed to
be taking forever and the top of Sunwapta Pass ( 6719 ft ) was a long way
off judging by the size of the river we were following. A stop for pancakes
helped me wake up some, but when we started off again a light rain had
started. It wasn't a hard rain, but we did have to stop and put our rain
jackets on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As we climbed up the pass, we began to see lots of cyclists
coasting down. These riders were part of a commercial bike tour, and had
been dropped off at the top of the pass. At the time that sure seemed like
a good idea! This day was the hardest for me. It seemed like we hadn't
had any downhill since we started, and I had been in my middle chainring
all day. My knee was okay, but my butt was sore, and now my achilles was
starting to hurt! Dave's hands were bothering him – he did the rest of
the ride with a sock stuffed in each glove. Then Dave had another flat,
and I think we were both going through a low spot. Danelle, and then Harold
and Mack stopped in their support vehicles to give us some encouragement.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We finally crested Sunwapta, and had a wet, bumpy descent
(finally !) most of the way to the control at Saskatchewan River Crossing.
After lunch (vegetable lasagna), we started the next climb up to Bow Summit
( 6762 ft ). It had finally warmed up enough so that we could take off
our arm and leg warmers. We could see some showers in the distance, so
it was just a matter of time before we'd be putting our rain gear on again.
Sure enough, right when the climb to Bow got serious, so did the rain.
There was no wondering about where the summit was, as we could see the
road cut into the forest from a ways out. Soon after the top was one of
the prettier sights of the day – Bow Lake reflecting the peaks and glaciers
behind it. The ride along the Icefields Parkway is one of the prettiest
stretches of road I've ridden.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After Bow, we had a nice rolling descent into Lake Louise,
then another 60 km into Banff. Traffic on this part was heavier, as we
were on Hwy 1. On the stretch to Banff, my achilles was getting worse.
In retrospect, I think my sore butt was causing me to sit crooked on my
saddle, which was screwing up my pedalling. I started taking aspirin for
the rest of the ride, which kept the inflammation under control.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We rolled into the control at the Banff High School around
10pm. Glen Smith had already checked in and left 7 hours before us! He
would end up with a time of 59:15, with only a few hours of sleep during
that time. He had told one of the support people about a problem he was
having with his computer. It had stopped working while he was riding during
the night. He tried tapping on it, pushing buttons, but was unable to get
it to work. It was after some time he realized that it was not working
because he was standing over his bike on the shoulder of the road, not
riding at all!</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Day Three: Banff – Kamloops (493 km)</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>We got on the road at 3am Saturday morning. The roads
were wet, but the high overcast looked like we might have a good day. Kicking
Horse Pass (5386 ft) was barely 500 ft higher than Lake Louise – we had
barely broken a sweat before we stopped for breakfast at a café
just past the summit. I was surprised at how good I felt this morning -
I think we had both gotten through the low point of the ride. It was probably
a combination of things: the weather was clearing, we had more downhill
than up, and we were on the last page of the route sheet - things were
looking much better. A couple of nice downhills with only a bit of climbing
got us into the control at Golden. After lunch (meat lasagna), we were
on the road towards Rogers Pass ( 4349 ft ). We could see showers ahead
of us in the valley, and we wondered if we would be putting our rain gear
on before the summit. I ended up getting to the store at the top without
any rain. Dave was only a few minutes behind, but he had to stop and put
on his rain gear for the last mile or so. After a pleasant conversation
with a Dutch couple who were cycling the same route, but at a more leisurely
pace, we were off down the pass. This 70 km stretch towards Revelstoke
was mostly downhill, with only a few rollers to get over. We got there
with a few hours of daylight left. My original plan was to stop here and
do the remaining 200 km after some rest, but we decided to push on through
to the finish. It would be hot the next day, so riding in the evening and
finishing in the morning would be better.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Thinking we could finish in under 72 hours, we started
off at a fast pace, but after an hour or two we slowed to a more realistic
pace. It was close to midnight when we got to the control at Salmon Arm.
After a quick stop there, we headed for the finish. My exuberance earlier
in the day had given way to fatigue. It was almost too cool that evening,
and we stopped to put on arm and leg warmers. The stars and moon were out,
making it a beautiful night for riding, and I was hoping to ignore my sleepiness
until we got to the finish. My eyelids drooped and my speed dropped so
much that I had to stop in Chase for a sleep break. Dave and I found a
comfortable porch, and I slept for an hour until my snoring woke me. 50K
now! It felt like I was able to double my speed after our break, but we
still were not very fast over those last miles. The moon had set, and soon
we were able to seen the sun shining on the hills above the river. Finally
we saw the traffic light that marked our turnoff to the park at the finish.
The people at the finish were still sleeping in their tent when we rolled
up. They had been out on Bob's motorcycle during the ride taking pictures
of the riders (what a great souvenir, to bring home some pictures of the
ride). The picture of Dave and I at the finish shows a couple of tired
randonneurs. Our time was 74:33, which easily beat my estimate. Ron finished
a few hours later at 78:10. After breakfast, a shower, and a nap, the finishers
enjoyed Richard and Fearon Blair's hospitality at their house in the hills
above Kamloops.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When I was getting everything ready to leave Seattle for
the ride, Bonnie told me she hoped I would find what I was looking for
on the ride. I hadn't really thought I was looking for anything, and had
puzzled over it during the ride. It was on the last day - after the climbs,
and the rain, and the lack of sleep, and the great support, and the spectacular
scenery, and the other riders, that I realized what it was. I found that
I <I>was</I> a randonneur!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Thanks to Bob Marsh and the many BC Randonneurs that organized
a challenging and beautiful 1200.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Visit my mom in Connecticut</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Ride BMB</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Participate in forming a new US randonneuring
organization</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>I Love NY - Not.</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Visiting mom was a great idea, flying into New York City
(NYC) was not.  Mom lives only 30 miles from the Big (rotting) Apple. 
The plan was to arrive at 1 AM and rent a car to avoid traffic congestion. 
I am completely convinced that what ever you do in or around NYC is a giant
hassle and/or a hustle.  Everybody has their hand out or in your pocket. 
I’ll leave this subject except to note my Budget rental car ended up costing
twice that of what I was lead to believe, no apologies were made. 
This is such an aggressive area I can’t imagine anyone surviving cycling
here even with full body armor.  Let me never again complain about
the our quality of life in Seattle.  Personally, I feel Woodland Park
Zoo is a more civilized community than NYC.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The sleepy little Connecticut town of Greenwich looks
to have been lost in a time warp for the 27 years I’ve been gone. 
They still have police directing traffic on G-Ave.  My old haunts
were still intact and the upscale store fronts look much the same as yesteryear
less a Starbucks or two, has the infection begun?  A preponderance
of the residences are old money living on old estates.  With NYC only
a 40 minute train ride away bankers, insurance executives and Wall street
brokers abound.  Once claimed the distinction of "The richest town
in the eyes of the world," this community can afford to ignore current
fads.  I couldn’t help noticing an absence of cyclists, bike lanes
and bike shops or the addition of Bentley and Aston Martin to auto row
along side the established Ferrari, Rolls, Mercedes, Porsche and Jaguar
dealerships.  I guess golf is still the primary form of exercise. 
Visiting family generally puts my stress meter out of category, you know
the saying about "family and fish."  My brother and his family came
up from the Jersey shore and my favorite uncle came over.  The 4 day
visit was inexplicably too enjoyable despite the 90 degrees and 90 percent
humidity.  Everyone got along and of coarse great food helped. 
When the time came it was difficult to leave.  Driving north to Boston,
near Danbury, CT I noticed the traffic was at a stand still on south bound
I-84.  This traffic jam lasted for almost 15 miles.  I made a
mental note to not return this way and remembered why I left for the west
years ago.</FONT>

an extraordinary event.  I can’t praise the organization, support
and camaraderie for BMB enough.  It is by far the best run brevet
and toughest route I’ve experienced and this includes the likes of PBP,
Rocky Mountain 1200 and Super Scandinavia 1200.  Every aspect of BMB
is meticulously planned and executed.  The start/finish hotel is rurally
located yet has easy access to the interstate if you’re driving. 
For non-drivers tram service to downtown Boston and the airport is across
the street.  The hotel runs an airport limousine if that’s your preference. 
The controls are manned by caring supporters, many are BMB veterans with
compassion for your passion.  Each control served up great vittles
and seemed to compete for best in class.  My favorite was the pork
fried rice but the pizza, pasta, deli sandwiches and chicken soup were
memorable.  Sleeping, shower and bag drop services were available
at the controls on the out and back route.  <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Pierce
Gafgen</A> was the archangel of technical support, always hovering where
needed with a big grin and joking.  All this plus a plethora of goodies
including the great looking and practical jersey/jacket (see above) were
covered by the entry fee.  Little things like Ensure Plus for breakfast
prior to the 4 AM start and a family of eager supporters at the controls
make you feel cared about.  Nothing was overlooked.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Jennifer said "expect one day of rain during BMB, it’s
a fact."  Well, it rained and blew as hard as I’ve ever seen the evening
prior, but come morning the start was cool and misty, perfect riding conditions
if you didn’t wear eye glasses.  Following a group photo, we were
lead out the first 15 miles by a pace car, after that we were left to follow
the Dan Henry markings at each turn or route change.  This relegated
the 16 page cue sheet to a back pocket.  In about an hour the little
hills started and my knees began to ache, not a new phenomenon but worrisome
so early on.  At about mile 45 a secret control was a good place to
dig into my stash of pain pills.  After leaving the first control,
Bullard Farms, I met <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Stig</A>, a 29 year old randonneur
from Denmark.  We rode a similar pace so made a pact to stick together. 
Not a stranger to audax style riding, Stig was fun to chat with since he
knew a number of the Danes I met on last year’s Scan. 1200.  Endurance
riders world wide are a small community so it’s not surprising to cross
paths in far off places.  Stig was on a quest, this being his third
1200 Km this year and he was going to Australia in October for a fourth. 
If successful, he’ll be the first to ride four 1200 k’s in four different
countries on three different continents in one year.  This was one
strong dude, grinding up the steepest hills in a 42 X 24 and always smiling. 
I got slower on each succeeding hill (of which their were many) but Stig
always waited.  Fortunately we made up some time on the wily descents. 
Pulling into Brattleboro with116 miles and 6,000’ elevation gain (EG) on
our legs about lunch time and we were eager to replenish spent calories. 
An entree of fried rice, vegetable, pork and chicken among other delicacies
hit the spot.  The sky was blue, the sun bright and life is good.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After leaving Brattleboro we came up on a little fireball,
Amy, who was working the hell out of her tricked out triathlon bike. 
We talked a while and I mentioned "what a shame that Americans don’t share
the gift of riding together."  She shot back "Hey, this is America,
every man for them self" and with that kicked it up a notch and disappeared
into the horizon.  Stig and I were making good progress despite my
slow climbing.  We both planned to get a few hours sleep at the Middlebury
control (240 miles, 14 K+ total EG) then head out early for the out and
back to Montreal (270 miles, 6,000 EG) sleeping again at Middlebury before
retracing our route back to Boston.  The relatively flat second day
leg looked on paper to be a rest day, Ha!  So far the scenery was
serene and pleasant, not spectacular as is Washington state.  The
sun just set as we approached the formidable Middlebury Gap, this 6 mile
climb is rated at 15 percent for the top 2 miles.  Fortunately it
was cool and dark, so you couldn’t see further than your headlight beam,
this helping your psyche.  Resorting to my fabled serpentine maneuver
I felt if I went any slower I’d be going back in time.  I swear people
walked past me.  Again, Stig waited at the top.  Arriving at
the Middlebury control just after 10 PM a hot shower, pasta and bed beckoned
but not before some serious play time with Aspen (Golden Retriever) the
resident entertainer.  Up at 3 AM and on the road before four, we
were in a lot of company.  I suggested to Stig "we could be back before
dark," (yea, but what day!)  At the Rouses Point control, before crossing
into Canada, the times for those returning from Montreal were surprisingly
slow.  This should have been a warning.  Our current tailwind
would become a headwind on the way back and yesterday’s effort plus eighty-five
degree temperature took it’s toll on the energy level.  We reached
the Montreal turn around control mid-afternoon and none of the lounging
riders showed much enthusiasm for heading back into the wind.  Eventually
five of us formed a pace line to share the burden.  Just as we were
leaving in comes solo rider smiling <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Jack Eason</A>,
a 72 year old Brit who ended up finishing the full 750 miles in 85 hours. 
What a hero.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was close to dark by the time Stig and I left Rouses
Point for Middlebury, 85 miles away.  The pace line from Montreal
had punished my knees but I couldn’t imagine going it alone.  They
ached more than ever even with the Codeine I was taking.  At some
point Stig and I got separated in the dark, not to worry, lots of other
zombies were out struggling to make progress.  Crossing the Lake Champaign
causeway I felt raindrops.  The sky was clear and the moon bright,
what’s going on, my feeble brain struggles with the contradiction. 
I later found out that the wind blew spray up over the road from the lake
6 feet below.  Now riders started bunching up and riding two abreast
trying to keep each other awake with conversation when along comes a Vermont
state patrolmen.  It’s midnight in the middle of nowhere and this
guy is lecturing us about bicycling single file, "It’s the law." When I
interjected "isn’t it the law for cars to dim headlights to oncoming traffic?"
he got really defensive about his natives not recognizing cyclists and
thinking we were upside down cars or some such rubbish.  This foray
did serve to elevate my adrenaline.  I was riding with a nice guy,
Barry from Colorado.  He was totally zoned out and just trying to
get in to Burlington where a motel room awaited him.  My knees were
now making an hideous scratching sound as if a scotchlite pad had replaced
the meniscus cartilage.  My big concern was am I doing permanent damage? 
Arriving at the SUSSE CHALET around 2 AM Barry stumbled to his room and
I asked the night desk man (John) if a room was available?  I’d decide
my fate after some sleep.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Boston-Montreal-burlington (BMb) Randonnneur-Abandoneur.</I> 
Up at 5:30 AM feeling rested but the knees no better.  Sitting in
the lobby drinking hot coffee with ice packed on my knees I asked John
about transportation to Middlebury.  He volunteered to give me a lift
when he got off at 7.  Wow what  hospitality, who said Vermonters
are reserved.  It was a done deal and I have no regrets.  Granted
I may have been a finisher had I ridden slower with longer off bike breaks
but that’s hindsight.  The problem at hand was getting my bike into
John’s Geo Metro.  John is well educated and fascinating to talk with. 
He’s a sign language interpreter at a local school, a scrabble whiz and
a AA member, as are a number of my friends.  I have nothing but respect
and admiration for John and we now communicate via e-mail.  In Middlebury
I caught another lift with Charley, also an abandoneur and currently supporting
his buddy Barry who I rode with to the motel.  Charley was another
super guy from Colorado.  He was very encouraging about my knee problem
and suggested I visit Dr. Andy Pruitt in Bolder, famous for getting abused
knees back in action.  At Ludlow Tim gave me a lift to Bullard farms. 
Tim was from Pennsylvania and supporting his buddy Joel.  His dedication
to support, gregarious and infectious personality gave me cause about abandoning. 
Not long after arriving at Ludlow Stig pulled in with a new and capable
riding partner, Jeff.  They were well matched and would finish strong. 
Then the Quad-squad came in.  This jovial upbeat bunch is a real irritation,
they exhibit none of the gaunt zoned out look once aptly described as "two
holes in the snow" that’s standard issue on these events.  The Quad
event covers exactly the same route as the 1200 km except they turn around
at Middlebury, covering approximately 200 Km each day then party and sleep
to their content.  They can only be accused of having too much fun
cycling while their comrades suffer.  One of them, <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Holly</A>
- current UMCA miles contender, I knew from Hell Week in Texas.  She,
her friend <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Linda</A>, Ken B. and I went to dinner
the eve of BMB.  Some riders don’t or can’t appreciate their style
but I’m convinced and plan to come back to ride the Quad.  Having
riders with support vehicles has a benefit I never dreamed of, that being
I was back in Boston by 6 PM that day.  After cleaning up I hung out
at the finish where I met <A HREF="SIR-Photo.htm">Leana</A>, Stig’s Danish
friend and a delightful lady.  She anxiously awaited Stig’s arrival
although he was still 10 hours away from finishing.  Sunday was banquet
day and as riders trickled in their effort was acknowledged with cheers,
applause and hugs from loved ones.  The later finishers reaped the
biggest rewards.  An old biker buddy from Seattle, Ken Brooker, now
residing in Virginia, drove up to visit.  He willfully lent a helping
hand in serving the banquet meal and socialized with fellow cyclists. 
While I was riding BMB he was busy checking out future job related opportunities
in New Hampshire.  I wish him the best of luck.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>BMB is an extraordinary event for normal people performing
exceptionally.  For the complete BMB results see: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/2750/result98.html">http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/2750/result98.html</A></FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Randonneuring re-organization</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#BaP">Jennifer Wise</A>, BMB director and president
of Randonneurs Mondiaux, held a meeting the Monday following BMB to reinvigorate
randonneuring in America.  Over the past years the ACP, France, US
Regional Brevet Administrators and individual randonneur members have been
exceedingly frustrated and discouraged by the czar of International Randonneurs
(Syracuse) consistent lack of leadership and unresponsiveness to requested
information.  These destructive policies have greatly hindered progress,
finally prompting corrective action that will become self-evident shortly. 
At this time all I can allude to is that very positive changes are on the
way in the form of an entirely new broad based organization with a focus
on service and growth.  Within the next few weeks a mailing will be
sent to all current US randonneurs explaining the goals and objectives. 
Do not confuse this with the current IR newsletter which contains empty
promises to mend its ways.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In conclusion - For me, all 3 phases of this trip were
a great success although next time I’ll do a few things different. 
I made new friendships, reestablished old ones and learned much. 
One can’t ask for more.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Here is an excerpt from the book "In the Zone" by Peter
Potterfield.  Try substituting the word "randonneuring" for "climbing."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>"Climbing is the best foil I've found for the onerous
of the twentieth century.  It keeps me in touch with the sun and moon
and stars, with wind and terrain, with my body and my abilities, and quite
often, with the texture of my fear.  I enjoy it immensely, when I

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Major Meltdown of a "Proper Attitude"</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I was doing a last gasp training ride preparing for Boston-Montreal-Boston. 
I chose a route of about 120 miles in the Mt. Rainier National Park area
with approximately 12,000’ of elevation gain.  Starting at the Crystal
Mt. turn off (Hwy 410,) I climbed Cayuse Pass, descended down to Grove
of the Patriarchs, up the Stevens Canyon to Paradise, then down to the
town of Packwood via Skate Creek (Forest Road 52,) back up Cayuse Pass
and hopefully finishing where I started.  The first 2 big climbs,
Cayuse Pass and Stevens Canyon, were pure pleasure done with fresh legs
and cool morning mist but now it’s 8 hours into this mayhem.  I was
just above the tunnel on the return climb of Cayuse Pass where the afternoon
sun and 100 plus miles about had me on the ropes.  I stopped and was
bent over my handle bars trying to figure a better way out of this suffering
but mostly cursing my stupidity for this misadventure when a car stopped. 
My sprits rose from the ashes thinking a good Samaritan was going to take
pity on my sorry ass and offer a lift, which was within my capability of
accepting when they asked "which way to Paradise?" my feeble response was
"not this way!"</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>REMINDER - Here is a consolidation of SIR '98 brevet results
to date.  Each PBP qualifying brevet you complete is assigned a unique
ID number by ACP, France.  If you wish to enter PBP you must submit
these numbers on your application form.  The ID number appears on
your control card, which will be returned to you once the brevet results
have been certified by ACP.  (Note: SIR results have not been certified
yet, so don't be concerned that you haven't received your 1998 cards.)  
The SIR RBA (currently Larry Ricker) will also keep track of the SIR brevet
ID numbers.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>IMPORTANT:  If you have completed a non-SIR qualifying
brevet (in Canada, for example), it is your responsibility to maintain
a record of the ID number.  If you don't have your card you will need
to contact the brevet organizer.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>If "2Y" appears to the left of your name, our information
indicates that you must complete a full brevet series (200, 300, 400, 600)
in both 1998 and 1999 in order to qualify for PBP.  Please review

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>400 Km  June 20 -21st Reported by Don Harkeroad,
Brevet Organizer</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Ron Himschoot and I completed the brevet on the 13th
of June as a preride to check out the course since there was some concern
about the construction on Hwy. 2 above Skykomish. That proved to be a nonuse
given the light traffic in the early morning.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>On the 20th, 20 randonneurs launched from Terry Zmrhal’s
house.  The early morning skies were clear with stars just before
the dawn.  As everyone turned onto Hwy 2 low morning clouds provided
cover up to Skykomish where the sun came out.  Peter Bajema led the
pack with Rick Hippe, Kendall Demaree and Jan Heine in close pursuit. 
The best of the rest were spread out in 3’s and 4’s riding at their own
pace.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Stevens Pass spread everyone out from this point on. 
Rick Hippe, who contracted a virus, would have been up at the front, but
started feeling the effects over the hill.  Peter Bajema, Kendall
Demaree and Jan Heine came in to the second control at Leavenworth pretty
much together where they were met by Ron Lee and Lynn Vigesaa with croissants,
bananas, and water.  Ken Carter and Rick Hippe came along soon after
and took off together.  Smilin’ Greg Cox showed up and seemed to be
enjoying himself immensely.  At this point I proceeded up to Blewett
Pass to man the "secret control".</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The order of arrival of everyone at Blewett Pass was
pretty much set for the rest of the brevet.  The weather conditions
were a little hot for the 21 mile ascent.  Ken Carter stopped and
cooled his feet off in a stream along the way.  As far as I know,
he was the only one to do that, although I’m sure many more seriously considered
this option.  I’ll say right here everyone showed up at the top of
Blewett Pass with a good attitude.  That’s a tough climb.  Ron
Himschoot arrived to helped me manage the control.  Greg Cox stayed
the longest while I admired his 12-28t Exa-drive Campy cassette. 
Dang, I need one of those.  Long about this time, thunder clouds rolled
in with a smattering of rain, but it never really amounted to much. 
The last rider up was Bob Magyar with a smile on his face.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Ron and I took off from here to Cle Elum for a bite to
eat, then I proceeded up I-90 counting riders as I went.  I finally
ran across Ken Carter, Rick Hippe, and Dave Johnson in a pace line in the
valley headed north.  Ron Lee and I arrived late at the intersection
of West Snoqualmie rd. and Woodinville/Duvall rd.  to man a secret
control.  Peter Bajema, Kendall Demaree and Jan Heine had already
gone through, so we decided to be consistent and not sign anyone’s control
card to avoid confusion at IR.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>There was some confusion over the last 23 or so miles
where Highbridge Rd. was really dark and a little convoluted unless one
had a lot of experience riding it.  Most people arrived off Woodinville/Duvall
Rd. in pretty good spirits which made the ride on Highbridge not so difficult. 
I think riding in small groups became an important factor by this point.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Anyway, to make a much longer story shorter, everyone
who arrived at Terry’s house enjoyed food and drink and stories from other
riders.  At this point, I want to thank my assistants, Ron Lee and
Lynn Vigesaa for their help in signing up everyone at the start and manning
the control at Leavenworth; Ron was at the secret control at the intersection
of Woodinville/Duvall and Snoqualmie Valley Rds.  until he had to
go home.  Also I want to thank my buddy Ron "megameterman" Himschoot
for helping out all over the place.  A very special thanks to Terry
and Melissa for donating the use of their house at the start/finish line. 
Thanks to all of the participants for making this a fairly successful brevet.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I only gave out one 400 km medal for some reason. 
This was my fault.  I’m not sure how we’ll get medals to those that
ordered them, maybe when the 600 km rolls around since I left the bag in
Terry’s garage along with the stamp paraphernalia.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Rumor Has It</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Duane and Max had a few mechanical problems so asked how
their brevet went.  Duane replied.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Max is a constantly upbeat person, so it's good for ones
frame of mind to ride with her.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>She had a couple of flats, the first one we noticed as
we left the North Bend truck stop.  The next one was on West Snoqualmie
Valley Rd.  After we fixed that we noticed that her cassette wouldn't
freewheel any more.  Needless to say, our minds weren't too quick
at this time of day!  Finally I noticed that she had a plastic spoke
protector and it was no longer attached to the spokes.  It didn't
look like it would be reattachable, so we cut it off.  She hopped
on the bike and commented that it had never worked better! [Comment from
Max - As for the plastic spoke protector, "removal" is too easy a word,
we stabbed it apart, in the dark, with my little screwdriver and then pulled
at the pieces with a metal adjustable wrench until we could forcibly rip
them off!--]</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Off and on, during the day, Max had her front fender
rubbing a bit.  Ron H. suggested that she get rid of what ever mount
she was using (or modify it, I can't remember which), and instead hold
it in place with zip ties.  On the Portland 600 km, my rear fender bracket
broke, and I zip tied the fender on, which does seem to work fine.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Max also has yet to get her front generator (FER generator)
working.  So, she had the light in place but used some sort of "heavy"
(her words, I didn't actually see the thing) battery.  This is the
same generator that Ken Carter uses, so obviously it can be made to work
properly.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>She also needs to carry more tubes (she only had one)
but she's probably figured that out.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Aside from that, everything seemed to be working for
her, so I think she'll be up for the 600 km.  Probably with these few
mechanical things cleared up, and her being a bit more efficient at controls,
she can accumulate enough time to allow her to sleep a few hours (which,
in my book, is a good thing!).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>We felt bad about not waiting for Bob (we'd all been
together, off and on, though did the climbs at our respective paces, reconnecting
on the downhill.  But on the Blewett climb we got a fair bit ahead
of him.  We took a break at a cafe, in Cle Elum, but he hadn't caught
up to us by the time we were ready to roll.  He actually came pretty
close, at the end.  I saw him just a mile from Terry's, as I was driving
home.  He looked a bit bushed!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I had a flat, a bit east of Snoqualmie Pass.  Fixed
it TOO quickly.  i.e. I jumped on the bike and left my pump behind! 
Oh well ...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Yes, I too want to see Max qualify for Paris!  She'd
turn those Frenchies on their ears!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Yesterday (Sunday) I too was a vegetable.  I slept
for five hours, got up, did a bit of house cleaning (Deirdre and Bob are
staying at my place, this coming week-end, so I'm actually doing house
cleaning!), then went back to bed!  Then I got up again and felt slightly
human!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>So you rode with Melissa.  It's a good thing to
ride with the women, for safety, I think.  Plus, Melissa and Max are
both pleasant company.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I should NOT have driven home, from Terry's, without
a power nap, or so.  I really had to fight to stay awake, and nodded
out, many times, though always caught myself ALMOST immediately! 
Fortunately there was almost NO traffic.  Max comments she too, should
have caught some Z's at Mr Z's as the eyelids were on auto close once off
the bike seat and into the comfy car!</FONT>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Riding the SIR 400 km</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>By Robert Magyar</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>My story starts the weekend before the 400 km.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After doing a 200 km ride with Max in Canada,  I noticed
that the frame on my road bike had developed a crack in the down tube. 
I quickly realized that my bike of 18 years was not going to be the one
I used on the 400 km.  I swapped my seat and road peddles onto my Mt.
Bike and put some narrow tires on the rims.  I rode my Mt. Bike into
work and it seemed that it would work fine.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 400 km event:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2:00AM - I wake up, my cat wants to know what is wrong?
Isn't time to keep sleeping? Right!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3:30AM - I sign in at Terry's house.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4:00AM - The twenty two of us peddle away into the dark.
I still don't feel awake.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I am riding with Max and Duane, and things are going well,
around 4:45 it's so light that our lights are no longer having any affect,
we shut them off.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It is only after stopping at the Skykomish control, that
I start feeling awake.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Halfway up Steven's Pass it's getting real sunny, Duane
continues on, Max dabs a little sunscreen on her nose and heads on up,
I stayed a few minutes and finished coating up. Caught up with Duane and
Max as they were heading towards Leavenworth.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Get out of Leavenworth at 1:00PM, and soon we are going
up Blewett pass, Duane and then Max disappear around the windy corners
heading up, after about an hour of hot climbing in the sun, I pull over
and cool off in the shade for 10 minutes, had an orange and did some water,
and then continued up the hill.  Small clouds start to block out the
sun, I think that's nice, but when they start rumbling with thunder, I
decide they aren't so nice.  As I crest the summit Ron Himschoot is
taking pictures of me and Don Harkleroad is standing there manning the
Secret Control, guess I could hauled a little less water up the hill.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>9:45PM Snoqualmie Pass Tunnel - The last of the day light
is disappearing over Snoqualmie Pass, and I am just about at the Tunnel,
I hit the switch on my Cateye Stadium Lamp and it starts to emit it's Nuclear
Blue Glow. I see just 2 cars behind me, so I peddle on into the tunnel. 
My light is lighting the whole right half of the tunnel, Floor to Roof.
Cars seem wary of the object emitting the Nuclear Blue Glow, they slide
smoothly into the left hand lane, long before they pass me.  Then
I am through.  I shut the big light off, I will save the rest of it
for the decent.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>10:30PM - I am at the summit, I turn the big light back
on and I descend Snoqualmie Pass at warp 9, with all the light I need. 
By 11:30 I am in North Bend having a snack and chatting with Ron Himschoot,
at the gas station.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1:30AM - I am started north on 203, heading to Duval,
I see a mile post sign and I think neat, just watch them count up to 15
and I will be in Duval, after a bit I see 2, then after a longer bit I
see 3.  I decide the miles markers are no longer fun.  Around
mile marker 12, I feel very tired and pull over and stop, I laid down in
a nice dry ditch and take a 10 minute nap.  Then back on the bike.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2:5XAMish - I find Duval's only stop light and go left,
I am glad there is only one light, because the street doesn't have a name
on it.  I cross the open feeling area and make my right hand turn,
I have double and triple checking my directions, because I know if I make
any wrong turns I will be beyond lost.  I am draining the last of
the big light here, I notice that the light is bight enough to see that
the grass is green, as I go up and down the hills by the dairy farms. 
When  I shift into my granny gear, I am happy that I am on my Mt.
Bike.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5:00AM - I am running out of directions and I no longer
need any lights on, as I pull into 232nd St. as Max is driving by in her
car, she cheers me on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5:30AM - I am back where I started.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After getting signed out, receiving my medal and congratulations
from Ron and Don, I start driving home, after 10 minutes things start to
get a little fuzzy, so I pull into the Texaco Gas Station, got a coffee
and donut, ate the donut, laid down in the back seat of my truck and sleep
for 2 hours.  Then I drove home.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a great ride.</FONT>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="FN"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Fleche Nordique (Scandinavia)</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>by Bengt Sandborgh - FREDRIKSHOFS I. F., Sweden</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Last weekend (May 23 - 24,) Pentacost, the 5th edition
of Fleche Nordique was held with finish in Skovde, Sweden.  Nine teams
had signed up, one team didn't start and one team DNF'ed.  So at the
finish we had 7 teams from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Fleche Nordique is a 24 h team event, held according
with ACP rules for Fleche Velocio.  Here is a ride report from my
team's ride.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I have done two previous Fleche using another route. 
This time I wanted something new.  The first thought was to try to
"win" the event (by filing and completing the longest ride of all teams). 
Last time a Danish team had completed a 630 km route.  My ambition
was to file a ride that long or perhaps a couple of k's longer.  One
problem with trying to win is that it will not be revealed beforehand how
long routes the other teams have filed.  So it`s a bit of a gamble. 
I was fully aware of that the chance of us failing was big.  But if
you wanted to chance a bit, this year was the time to do it.  In 2000,
when the next Fleche Nordique will be held, you will play it safe if you
want the completion for your "Brevet 5000" award.  That is if you
succeed in next years PBP.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I spent many hours studying maps and road books during
the winter.  A lot of things must be considered.  You don't want
to pass through big cities, it slows you down.  Though, if you really
stay in the "outback" you will find no shops no nothing to service you
during the ride.  Finally I had a good route planned, 640 km long. 
In Peter Toner I soon found one teammate, Bosse Eriksson was not keen but
agreed to join us.  Another experienced Randonneur Bjorn Granlund
volunteered to drive the support car.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>After the 300 k Brevet in April we where sitting rather
wasted in our (cycling)clubhouse and discussing the Fleche.  Bosse
said "I don't want to ride 640 k in 24 hours, It's so bloody hard work." 
So a compromise was worked out.  We would use my route but cut away
the first 140 k.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>On Saturday May 30 we started in Mankarbo 140 k north
of Stockholm.  We had 24 hours to complete 503 km.  The weather
was fine but a bit chilly.  We had a rather uneventful ride the first
240 k's.  Beautiful scenery and good roads with little traffic. 
In Vansbro Bjorn had found a good restaurant for dinner, which he told
us by cellphone.  After dinner the hardest part of the ride would
begin.  Hilly and 101 km's to next checkpoint.  It was now 9
pm and we mounted the lights on our bikes and dressed for the night.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The route now goes into the "Big Forrest".  Very
scarcely populated, just trees, trees and a lake here and there. 
Bear and elk (US moose) country.  At about 11 pm the slow Scandinavian
sunset made us switch on our taillights.  One hour out from Filipstad,
the next checkpoint, I phoned Bjorn.  He had found a gas station open
until midnight.  But watch out, he said, the local intelligentsia
is having fun here.  The cops just went away, look out for broken
bottles!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>A quarter before midnight we rolled into Filipstad and
soon found Bjorn.  I fired up a camping stove and soon large quantities
of coffee was consumed.  It was cold sitting there on the ground a
little sweaty and tired.  We decided to push on the next checkpoint
and there have a longer break.  It was "only" about 50</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>k's away.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>We now were into the darkest part of the night. 
But here that means you don't need lights to ride.  We just switched
them on when we saw a car approaching.  In the grayish darkness it's
no trouble seeing the road.  One hour out from Kristinehamn I phoned
Bjorn again.  This time he had found an all-night gas station. 
"I will park at the city limits and guide you in."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>We checked in at 2.15 am.  We calculated we would
have to start from here no later than 5 am to make it to the finish before
10 am.  Just 120 k's to go.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>After tossing and turning in the car (it's a VW mini-bus)
for a couple of hours we decided that we could just as well get going,
4.30 am we are on the road.  It's now full daylight again and the
lights are left in the car.  This stretch was the most boring one. 
We where tired and the road was broad, with long straights that seemed
endless.  In Mariestad 35 k's from Skovde and the finish we had a
breakfast before pushing on.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The finish in Skovde is beside the "Hotel Billingehus". 
The hotel is placed like the castle in "Where eagles dare" above the city. 
It is one of the hardest climbs in Sweden getting up there.  It's
perhaps 2 km long with the very last couple of 100 meters with a 12% climb.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>With a couple of minutes to spare we cruise over the
finish line and it's over.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>In a short period of time all the other teams trickle
in.  We meet friends from Super Brevet Scandinavia 97 and from PBP
95.  We now find out that a Norwegian team had filed a 630 km ride,
but they had "thrown in the towel" and did not finish.  We had won!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>After the lunch we received our medals and our team got
a big trophy as a price.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>To sum up, a great weekend together with great friends. 
The chosen route worked well with no troubles.     </FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>-</FONT></B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1>    Saturday, May 9, started like any other
cloudy day that was to include a SIR Brevet on the Peninsula.  I loaded
the car with bike gear in preparation for a rainy day and drove to Coleman
dock in time for an early ferry ride to Winslow.  The registration
went smoothly with 21 riders quietly filling out waiver sheets and getting
a baggy with map, route and control card inside.  The ferry landed
within 5 minutes of the 7:00am start time allowing a quick briefing and
then the riders slowly climbed the hill out of Winslow.  There were
three late registrations Jason Rye, Robert Magyar and John Campbell each
signed in and proceeded to start the ride 5 minutes behind all the others.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The support crew of Rich and Russ
drove ahead to the 36 mile point where SR 104 and US 101 cross over for
the only secret control on the route.  This location was used in 1997
so many riders were aware of the necessary stop.  Most riders took
advantage of the water and filled up their bottles while munching on a
banana or sport bar.  This year we had several new riders to the club
who were unfamiliar with the course.  With a long downhill to enjoy
just before the 180 degree left hand turn, two people decided to blaze
right by and headed due north.  Another rider took the short cut to
Quilcene and skipped the control altogether.  The couple realized
there was a mistake and returned in time to go through the control within
30 minutes of closing.  The riders had spread out over 50 miles by
the time the last riders checked in at Quilcene.  It was here that
a broken spoke claimed Deb and Joe Soy from completing the ride.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    By 12:30 the faster riders were pulling
into Union Country Store, with the rest spread out all the way back to
Quilcene.  The Union control as the halfway point became a lunch stop
for most of the riders.  The store has a selection of deli sandwiches,
fruit and plenty of drinks to choose from.  The counter person always
has a greeting for those riders who stop and patronize their store.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The next control at Bear Creek became
an adventure for two riders.  One unfortunate soul passed by the store
and proceeded to Gorst before turning around and after seeing no other
store decided to stop.  The second rider missed the turn in Belfair
and continued to Tahuya.  At about this time the support crew was
driving to Seabeck to offer assistance for the next 8 hours.  Knowing
in advance that the Seabeck store used for the control closes at 7:30 we
decided to have a vehicle there for signing control cards if necessary. 
While handing out fruit and drinks to the riders, Russ called the Winslow
control each hour to pass on the names and times of riders that had passed
through.  By 10:30 the support crew could account for 21 of the 24
riders and decided to drive to the finish.  Later we found that two
riders took the Bremerton ferry and the third rider proceeded home to Port
Orchard.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The finish at the Winslow ferry dock
was quiet until 7:20. At this time Rick Hippe, Bill Dussler and Michael
Bingle arrived. Peter Bajema, who had been with them the whole distance
was not among them.  He had flatted in Poulsbo and was waiting for
a long stemmed tube to finish.  The remaining riders filtered in every
15 to 20 minutes by 2's and 3's.  Only Robert Magyar and Max Maxon
finished several hours later, each as a lone rider.  As a much deserved
reward at the end of a ride, medals were handed out to those who had requested
them.  The riders were happy to have finished and even more pleased
to receive a medal in such a timely fashion.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Congratulations to those who traveled
from other areas to get to Seattle including Jason Rye from Bozeman, Montana
and Guy Oldfield from Richland, Washington.  Also to the new members
to SIR who finished; Melissa Kydd, Wayne Methner, Robert Magyar, Mark Thomas,
Peter Liekkio and Dan Peterson.  If there was a medal for determination
it would go to Max Maxon who finished at 1:30am just in time for the last
ferry ride back to Seattle.  She was truly a randonneur who endured
the distance, hills and night riding without support and companionship. 
Her attitude and smile at the finish were the end to a great day of riding.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Thanks to Duane Wright for helping
put together the maps and Rich and Russ for volunteering to stay up until
3:00am supporting the ride.  I applaud all the riders who participated
in the SIR 300 km classic and hope to see you at the SIR 400 km.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>     Twas the night before 300 km, and
all through the house,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>     A Fer Generator Light is Strewn
-- across the floor, on the coffeetable,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>     Everywhere, in fact, but on
the _(*&^$&*%* bike.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>    Scene opens on night-before safari
preparations:  No worries,  a sweet, patient mechanical engineer
has agreed to install the new generator-driving lighting system on Max's
bike, and will work for food.   Max  bbqs a Last Supper
of steak and tater tots.  The engineer begins work at 6:00 p.m.,...
have that generator on in no time, and Max, QUIT WORRYING?!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Max seeks solace at the bikestore
and finds:  reflective stars and moon stickers for the fender, a reflective
orange triangle, a new can of Gatorade powder to replace last year's petrified
rock version.  She tarries awhile, preferring not to see bicycle generator
parts all over the floor, not to participate in the engineering process. 
Max returns home to find the engineer with a newly purchased $100+ drill-and-bit
set (bright yellow drill, kinda cute color anyways) and a hole drilled
in the new generator -- hmmn, not looking good.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Max endures the bike physics lesson
-- "You see, if you put the generator on the back wheel, it will be VERY
HARD -- not just a little bit tough -- VERY HARD, you understand, to get
the back wheel off, or  to put it back on.  Max sulks and insists: 
"The generator must go on the back wheel for proper steering and bike balance?" 
Engineer relents:  "Well, okay, it can be done."  [Until awhile
later...] It can't be done.  The rear axle bolt is too short. 
No more stuff will fit on there, not now, not never.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The engineer escapes to the bike shop
looking for plan two and an alternate light in advance of tomorrow's ride
and the inevitable, fast approaching darkness, but it is closed.  
Max grabs her own screwdriver and drops it, curses, anxiously clockwatches,
fumbles with bolts and screws and material things that seem to stubbornly
resist any movement.   She wishes she had never given away the
opera tickets for that night --  oh, to be sitting at La Boheme right
now.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The engineer reappears, carrying a
few lead acid lantern batteries, some appliance cords, a roll of electrician's
tape, twisty-ties, and an electrical connector thing, and an alternate
lighting plan.  Max in fine anxious state, sees him beaming in the
doorway, but refuses to comprehend the smile.  [She doesn't get it,
in fact, until next evening at dusk...] At midnight she retires.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Four-thirty a.m. Max awakens to darkness
and can think of no good reason to leave a warm bed.  She dresses,
devours the Roast Beef Breakfast sandwich (guaranteed no burp ) panics
about the ferry --which is the Coleman Ferry dock anyway, and what if it's
in West Seattle[?]-- and drives downtown to the waterfront  and makes
the ferry.  She sees other randonneurs through a caffeine-deprived
view,  and signs on to the SIR 300 km brevet.  In a moment of foolishness,
she PRE-PAYS for the medallion.  It is raining, blustery, and generally
gray with a lot of choppy waves.  Ugh.  The ferry lands, the
bikers meet at the Winslow dockside, and Max's safari ride begins at 7:00
a.m.  As usual, she sees retreating animal hides (clad in lycra and
going fast) and then she is alone, and last.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Max pedals out of Winslow, along to
Poulsbo, through town,  turning onto Little Valley Road,  and
spots the first big game on her safari.  Indeed, it is much too early
for hallucinations, but as she is observing  the green fields, 
horses, and  ALPACAS [?]!  And not the regular llama cousins,
with long shaggy coats,  but these are very closely shaved, in poodle
style, with fur tufts at neck, ankles, and a little foof at the tail --
c'est bizarre, ca!   And in the corner of the alpaca pasture,
she looks twice, not believing:  A CAMEL, sitting with legs pulled
up beneath him.  "COUNT THE HUMPS," she thinks -- all camels have
humps, and nobody will ever believe I saw this creature -- damn, no camera." 
He is a 2-humper, and she names him "Joe," as she rides on wards, meditating
on the nature of   camels, and alpacas of the poodle persuasion.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At the Secret Control, Ken Carter
hails Max.  "Say hey, Max, you're not last  -- did you see those
two people ahead of you go down the hill and miss this turn?"  Since
stopping to take off her gloves, Max has seen no one.  Apparently,
Deb and Joe didn't are now racing downhill, off course at a goodly rate
of speed.  Can't stop and wait for them, must keep riding.  Sure
they'll catch her soon, she rides towards the control at Quilcene, looking
over her shoulder from time to time for her friends.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At Quilcene, the grocery sign says
"Home of Washington State's LARGEST ICE CREAM CONE."  Yum.  Max
considers a moment -- and decides against what might as well be Washington
State's biggest phlegm producer.  She buys  a banana and some
orange jelly candies, instead.   Max removes her helmet, and
observes a Harley Hog Dude  has just ridden up.  "Nice bike,"
she says,  following with, "No fair, your's has  an engine." 
The Harley guy is quite cool, says he's part of a Hog Drill Team. 
Wow, sounds like some action, she asks?  He laughs and says yeah,
they are attending the ONE HUNDRED THIRD ANNUAL SEQUIM IRRIGATION FESTIVAL
to ride in the parade.  Not much for action out here, I guess. 
Max tells him to look out for JOE CAMEL along the route, and rides out
of town.  The other Harleys are lined up outside the Oysterbar on
the way out of town.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Some distance up the road, she shakes
her head.  OOOpsie, too much ventilation up there -- oh _*(%*(%( helmet
is still at the store.  She rides back to Quilcene, attaches helmet
to head, makes a mental note about mileage being 3 miles off on odometer
now, and again passes the Harley line-up at the oysterbar, whilst considering
the potential of a cold beer.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Not now, NO BEER HERE, no time, and
no stomach.  Walker Pass looms, a scenic challenge.  More creatures? 
Here, by the side of the road, a deer stares at her.  "Hi, Bambi,
seen any bears around here?"  The top of Walker Pass is easier than
4 years ago -- whew, big relief.  Down the other side, she sees the
great rhododendron nursery  --  those rhodies must be on plant
steroids, they are TREES, covered in hot pink, deep red and shy white blooms. 
Passing Dosewallips State Park  Max remembers family vacations there,
and tempted to detour and find that waterfall she remembers.  No time
for off-road excursions, stay the course.  More course, and more course. 
There's "Mike's Beach," that's the good life, get your own beach! Up the
road Max finds comfort in the cream cheese and Marionberry rolls stuffed
into her jersey pockets -- yum, protein and sugar.  Aided by orange
jelly candies, she keeps cadence.  The water peeks in and out along
the left hand side of the road, and she watches the coastline vistas. 
No wind, thank goodness.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Feeling a bit run down, she looks
at her odometer -- 100 miles or so -- and realizes she hasn't stopped since
Quilcene.  She pulls over in front of a hotel/motel.  It is a
charming place, WITH VACANCY,  and a hot tub with a view of the water
-- WOW!  What a perfect place to stop, to abandon this lonely ride,
to call for company and stay the night here, then ride the 80 or so miles
back to the ferry TOMORROW.  Nutter butters restore her resolve, and
she turns the bike away from The Temptation Motel.  The road flattens,
winds along Hoodsport, and Max picks up the pace.  "I think I can,"
she thinks, "Besides, I've got all day -- and look, it's flat here -- I
can do this thing, I can finish."  The control town of Union 
appears.  MAX NEEDS TO EAT.  Turkey sandwich and fruit plate
-- straight up, straight down, no pickle, no onions.   The deli-keeper
is chatty, says there were others ahead  -- and are we really going
189 miles?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Feeling better, Max remembers her
helmet, gets on the bike and picks up the pace, onwards forwards, towards
the Bear Creek  Grocery Store.  Funny, she recognizes a biker
coming at her  in pink and black shorts, "He is one of us, why is
he riding the wrong way?" she muses.  She hails him, he hesitates
and pauses, but gives her the thumbs up.  "Perhaps he left something
at a control or is leaving the ride," she thinks.  Soon she sees the
Bear Creek Country Store, but the name on the  cue sheet says Bear
Creek "Grocery" Store, so she continues past a few miles, hoping for the
right name on another store -- after all, her mileage is still off a bit
from the extra helmet trip in Quilcene --but there is nothing else to be
found out there in the boondocks, so she returns to the store and finds
it is the control.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Bear Creek Grocery Store Control and
SIXTEEN OUNCES of cold, red  Gatorade later,  Max consults her
directions:  "Return west to blah blah blah....  Hmmn. 
No direct access on a compass line anywheres, and it is tree-lined in here,
so no hint about setting sun setting west, well... return to road and continue
on," she thinks.  [Big mistake]  DOWN THE ROAD a ways, and Max
searches her control card.  The mileage on the odometer is an indeterminate
x- amount off.  She anxiously pedals faster, hoping to see the Cue
Sheet's promised right turn onto Route 300.  But it doesn't appear. 
Finally, she sees people, and stops to ask some folks at an outdoor birthday
party, where is this Route 300, anyways?  They very gently and 
kindly disabuse her of her cherished notion that west is east, and east
is west.  Max then "RETURNS WEST" in the true westerly direction 
(some 10 miles round trip?) back to the grocery control and  this
time back to the course!  "Guess the black-and-pink shorts guy was
"returning west" -- wish he'd said something?"  Now I'll never catch
him, or anyone else, likely.  Then to her amazement, she does see
someone else, two someones.   The Ron Lee and Lynne V team are
pedaling  strongly towards the grocery store.  "How the devil
did anyone get behind me? I didn't see them along the road?  Is there
now to be a hard fought BATTLE FOR LAST PLACE?"</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The sun is setting on the bicycle
safari, and Max tries does pedal penance for outcoursing the course. 
Feet fly and the flat with rollers landscape continues.  Max checks
and rechecks her map adjusting for the odd extra mileage disappearing incrementally
on her Something-Point-Oh-Something shy odometer, certain, it seems, to
never again coincide with the mileage on the cue sheet.  The forest
closes in with a turn away from the water, and suddenly it is DUSK. 
Max tests the lighting system, et voila, lots o' light.  Yippee.  
Cautiously, she turns on only the little Cateye Hyper for this dusk time,
saving the lead acid big guns for  darkest safari nighttime of lions,
tigers and bears.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The road bends.  The directions
say, "Bear left" on "such and such," but the street sign reads "such and
so."  Is this the bear-right place, or no?  The odometer is as
much help as a Magic 8 ball, so Max does not bear right just yet, and stays
on the road.  It curves, and she pedals up the biggest, most monstrous,
MOTHER-OF-HILLS AND LORD HAVE MERCY.  No mountain pass, this, it is
very steep, and it is Eternal.  With each curve, the UPHILL continues. 
Max contemplates the myth of Sisyphus, and  disheartened, disembarks
and begins pushing the bicycle up and around another curve.  At some
point she tires of pushing and finds she has enough breath left to pedal. 
Angry at the hill, she pounds pedals using full body weight and standing,
standing, standing.  At last, the summit.  But no downhill the
other side, a curving place and  what?  another uphill? 
Dear god.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The moon rises some, and the 
intersecting roads once again match the cue sheet.  This is good comfort. 
It is dark now, and the road goes through tall trees which block out the
rising moon light.  It is BLACK AS THE BOOGEYMAN'S CAVE.  Max
sings a bit to herself, turns on various lights, and keeps to the steady
pedal pace,  wondering about bears.  Sure enough, in the spelunker
helmet light, yellow animal eyes shine forth.  The eyes freeze, then
move closer.  "DON'T LET IT EAT ME," she prays.  The eyes look
into her light, and she discerns fur, ears, and long, skinny legs: 
it is NOT a bear.  [Just] a deer continues across the road ahead of
her -- whew.  On through the darkness past a swamp, and a chorus of
the loudest frogs she has ever heard.  She hums: "Jeremiah was a Bullfrog,
da dum dum... "</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    It is past 10:00 p.m., and some time
before midnight.  She thinks she is now on Dewatto road, being quite
careful to examine the cuesheet to avoid getting lost.  It is pitch
black  and she rides down the road in this nowhere place.  
A sudden staccato gun report cracks open  the night:  "KAPOW!" 
Then another, "KAPOW," and another, "KAPOW."   What are they
shooting? Is it dead yet?  Why is it getting closer?  Fearful
of being mistaken for an animal, she musters her best  authority and
yells: "HOLD YOUR FIRE.  DON'T SHOOT,  PEOPLE ON THE ROAD!" and
rides closer.  In the blaze of big pickup truck headlights, she sees
a man approach a point concealed by the bluff.  He bends over and
extends his arm  to ....  She can't quite see.  Is he checking
for a pulse?  Retrieving a target?  Delivering the coup de grace
to a shot-up deer? She can't see.  But remembering her spelunker headlight
shines wherever she looks, and not wanting to attract attention, she stares
straight ahead turns off the helmet light, and circles  feet and her 
pedals down the road.  "What are they shooting?  Don't know. 
Don't want to know.  What I don't know is better not to know. 
Keep pedaling."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    More hills, more darkness, and the
final control at Seabeck appears.  Max grins at Ken Carter's dad. 
She swaps one lead acid battery for a fresh one.  Lighting system 
is working great--thank you oh mechanical engineer!  She decides against
adding a 4th light, (the Nightrider)  since the lead acid in her quads
is working against her now, and threatening to outweigh the lead acid battery
in the trunk bag.  Spirits return, and she puts on a happy face. 
Only 28 miles to go -- and if she hurries, can just catch the 1:30 a.m.
ferry.  Yippee.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Back into the dark.  And UP 
Anderson Hill Road, is this a cruel joke?  The blazing lights shoot
straight ahead, making the end of this uphill anybody's dark guess. 
Max again pushes her bike, eating nutter butters and thinking it might
have been sane and warm and good to  DNF at the Seabeck control, at
least she wouldn't be out here alone,  fighting dark uphills, 
trying to make an impossible ferry, trying to push the pace in the last
28 miles of a 200 mile safari?  But the Anderson uphill relented into
downhill.  Might have been a glorious downhill in daytime, but Max
kept the brakepads warm, not wanting to ride into a midnight hole.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The close trees gave way to friendly
shoulder-of-highway back through Poulsbo. Max is most happy to see cars
and civilization again, especially happy to see big green roadsigns that
tell her she is not lost, she is on the right road, going HOME.  She
rides the highway towards the Winslow ferry dock.  A few maniacal
drivers scream by -- trying to make the 1:30 a.m. ferry.   Ken
Carter pulls up in a car, Ken's friendly voice says "Hey Max, see you at
the ferry" and he is gone.  Yeah right, she thinks, the 1:30 a.m.
ferry -- last ferry until 6:30 a.m.  If I miss the 1:30 ferry, have
to hang at ferry dock for 5 hours in dark all alone or pedal (more) to
a motel and get a room somewhere at 2:00 a.m.?  Max narrows her focus
to HOME and starts a tired, ALL OUT FERRY TIME TRIAL.  A long gentle
downhill helps her, and there it is:   the Ferry!  It is
1:33 a.m. as she boards the  ferry~!  Yippee.  And there
is Ken Carter, with her medallion.  Wow.   Some 300 km safari
adventure.  One question, she asks:  "Did you see the camel?"</FONT>

Rambo's Revenge</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>by Duane Wright</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>    He came, he saw ... he kicked butt
... big time.  He drew first blood, he drew last blood.  Marvin
C. Rambo, perennial organizer of the Portland randonneurs and current Portland
Wheelmen president, finally put the nay sayers in their place.  Rambo,
who historically can be counted on to always finish a brevet in the very
back, putting in long, lonely hours, by himself, destroyed most of the
field in the 98 Portland Randonneurs 600 km brevet over the week-end. 
The ride began at 4:00 a.m. from the Sandy Park and Ride (Sandy Blvd. at
I-205).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    With his steady pace, and his quiet
self-confidence, Marvin started out slowly, but gradually caught most of
the field.  Enjoying a tuna fish sandwich, at the Steamboat Island
deli (229 k), Marvin revealed that he had struggled a bit, at the start,
and had suffered a pinch flat just past the St. Helens control (59 k). 
"Then my butt started bothering me, so I had to buy some bag balm. 
I could only find a large can of it, so I had to take it.  Then I
had to find a place where I could apply it."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Rambo hung tough on the hills between
Olympia and Bremerton.  Eating a casual dinner, Saturday evening,
at the control at the Bremerton Dennys (306 k), Rambo remarked well, "I'm
thinking of just riding straight through - I have a social engagement on
Sunday afternoon and I'd like to be there."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    In a revealing moment, Rambo made
reference to his defeat on the 91 Paris Brest Paris ride, when he had to
abandon, just after Mortagne, due to delirium, and foot pain.  They
found him lying in the sun, too far gone to have the good sense to even
find some shade.  He was inspected by a doctor, who declared that
Rambo was done riding for the day.  "I had wanted to cry," said Rambo,
in his understated way, "but I was too dehydrated."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    On Saturdays ride, Marvin continued
along, destroying the hills on Highway 16, between Bremerton and Tacoma,
in the first hours of twilight, on Saturday evening.  The next morning,
the large number of riders behind him could only speculate on how far in
front of them he must be.  There was a rumor that he had spent an
hour resting at the Spanaway control (the 7-11 store, at 373k), but other
then that, the enigmatic Rambo's whereabouts remained a mystery. 
At press deadline his finish time was not yet available.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    When asked about his plans for Paris,
in 98, Rambo said, rather matter of factly, "Oh, I'll be there." 
The soft spoken, casually worldly Rambo, an obvious Francophile, resides,
appropriately enough, on Flavel St. in south eastern Portland.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    On the fast end of the pack, the first
three arrivals rode straight through, with the leader finishing in 26 hours. 
Coming in 28 hours were Mike Bingle and one other rider.  Bingle said
the three of them had hit the Centralia control (443 k) at sunset on Saturday
evening.  They decided to press on, through the night.  A tired
Vince Sikorski (formerly of the Seattle area but now living in Bend, Oregon)
announced that he was going to bed down for the evening.  "We were
a 600 km time trial," declared Bingle.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At the other end of the spectrum,
a delirious Duane Wright caught a tow with the strong tandem team of Steven
and Harvey, up from Sacramento, as they were leaving the final control
(St. Helens, 557 k).  Their worries about navigating the metropolitan
Portland portion of the return were put to rest when, at the north end
of the St. Johns bridge, they encountered Lloyd Weisensee and Kevin, local
Portlanders, coming out of a restaurant.  Lloyd pulled like a man
possessed, emitting his own thunder, along the Portland airport, as the
jets thundered on the tarmac in the background, taking the entire group
all of the way to the finish.  When asked where he had gotten the
energy for the final stretch, he said 'I'd just eaten a giant hamburger,
in the restaurant."  The group of five came in at 38:46.  Shortly
after them were George and the other Portland cross-bike rider.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Wright had ridden most of the brevet
with Nat Ersoz, also of the Seattle randonneurs.  Ersoz, a newcomer
to the rando scene, had been a superdomestique for the aging Wright, towing
him from Portland to Olympia.  Somewhere north of the Vader control
(128 k) Ersoz started to be plagued by flats,  a nightmare that was
to continue for the remainder of the ride.  Finally Ersoz reached
the end of his rope (and the end of north Americas supply of tubes) and
threw in the towel, just south of Tenino (389 k).  He and Wright had
made the Spanaway control with only five minutes to spare.  Wright
made it on, to the Centralia control, arriving there also with only three
minutes to spare.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At the finish, only minutes before
course closure, a very tired and somewhat incoherent Jack came stumbling
in.  He explained his uncustomarilly late finish to riding someone
elses ride.  I'm not a fast rider, so I tend to only stop at the controls
and try to keep my breaks short.  I rode for a long ways with two
riders [he did NOT mention Lloyd and Kevin by name] who like to stop at
every restaurant and bar.).</FONT>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="BCF"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>BC Randonneurs Fleche
- THE TERMINATORS ARE BACK</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>By Duane Wright</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>    The Terminators, Ken Bonner, Keith
Fraser, and Ted Milner, reclaimed the distance trophy via their efforts
in the 1998 B.C. Randonneurs Fleche Pacifique.  In a 24 hour time
period they rode 654 km.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The B. C. Fleche took place on May
8 through 10.  Eight teams participated, down from eleven teams in
1997.  Seven of the teams were from B. C. and one was from Washington
state.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    This year the communal Sunday morning
soaking took place in the outdoor pool at the Harrison Hotel.  The
brunch took place in the Harrison Hotel dining facilities at 10:00 a.m. 
In recognition of Mothers Day, each woman rider received a rose, compliments
of the hotel (several women were overheard to make comments about "24 hours
of labor.")</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The seating arrangement had the teams
rather spread out, so the awards ceremony was held outside, after the brunch. 
Harold Bridge, the fleche organizer, kept matters brief.  In addition
to the overall distance award, other awards were given, including one for
the team with the greatest distance x average age - this team included
Manfred Kuchenmuller and Real Prefontaine (Harold mentioned that "having
Real on ones team moves the average age up to 95!"), and the team with
the greatest age range - this team had a young Tim Pollock and, at the
other end of the spectrum, a 34 year old rider (hopefully riding with parental
permission).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The Washington state team was rumored
to be the largest (by number of persons, NOT by total weight!), at seven
(five bikes, including two tandems): Genny Gebhardt, Ron Himschoot, Dave
Johnson, Pat Marek and Nicole Nelson (tandem), Greg Sneed and Duane Wright
(tandem).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Harold informed us that we were the
only arrow (i.e. our route, from Lakewood to Harrison (via Bellingham)
was pretty much a straight line vs.  the circuitous routes of the
other teams.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At 366 km, we thought we would be
the team having ridden the LEAST distance, but apparently one other team
beat us for that distinction.  Our team was greatly assisted by the
diligent support of Nina Johnson, Lee Kanning, and Ruth Sneed.  Without
the beer and Mexican food that they provided for us, at Bellingham, it
would not have been the same ride!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Our team called itself "The Way of
All Fleche."  We were a large team: five bikes (and seven people -
incl. two tandems).  In short - an organizer's nightmare.  Exercising
the sometimes inefficient method of democracy (augmented by lots of e-mail,
not always in synch) we finally settled on a route:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Starting in Lakewood (where's that?!),
we would head due east to join the STP route on top of "The Hill" (the
only hill on the STP route).  Descending the hill would boost our
average travel time greatly, making the entire Fleche a POC (Piece of Cake),
or something like that!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    We would then take the STP route to
Seattle, then the RSVP route to Bellingham.  Then, after a long night
of sleep, we'd then finally be forced to do some actual navigation and
try to make it to Harrison Hot Springs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The team: Genny Gebhardt, Dave Johnson
(on mountain bike - he was prepared for the roads washing out, in case
the rain got heavy), Ron Himschoot, Pat Marek and Nicole Nelson (on new,
shiny blue tandem), Greg Sneed and Duane Wright (on tandem).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    It was raining at the start, so we
knew we had the right time and place.  The spirit was willing but
the fleche was weak.  We started off anyway, rolling along the plateau
of east Tacoma.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Eventually we reached the STP route. 
The rain made it impossible to descend "The Hill" at the speeds that a
tandem would like to, so we lost our secret weapon, early on, and now would
have to work to reach our destination within the allotted time.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The mud flap on the Sneed/Wright tandem
left something to be desired and Genny mentioned never having to use her
hydration system because of the buckets of mineral-rich water being constantly
thrown in her face.  That's just one of the features of a smooth operating
fleche team.  Dave tried to get a refund, because of the rain, but
I continuously assessed him fines for whining, which kept the balance sheet
equal.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    We were surprised and pleased to discover
that it was "Bicycle Saturday" along Lake Washington Boulevard.  The
route was closed to cars.  Due to the heavy rain, there were not bicycles
either, so we had a very quiet stretch here.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The rain was so heavy that Ron and
Greg started swapping nautical stories.  Instead of asking me to "stand,"
Greg occasionally asked me to "climb the mast, trim the sails," etc.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Just before Pert's Leschi Cafe (the
first control and a mandatory bicycle stop anyway), the blue tandem developed
a flat, which gave us a chance to appreciate the rain (as yet non-stop,
at this point) without having to bike in it.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The first portion of our route, from
Lakewood to Woodinville, was quite urban, which doesn't make for the fastest
travel time.  Most of us passed dangerously close to our respective
houses.  Genny was suffering from a cold, and said she would have
gone home and gone to bed, but she did not have her house key with her
(she was traveling light, her secret weapon).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    After another mandatory bicycle stop
at the Deli in Snohomish (a.k.a. Control #2) we quietly acknowledged that
it had stopped raining.  Talking out loud about such incidents only
invites trouble.  We took the trail that heads north from Snohomish.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Just north of Arlington we passed
a Fleche team of B.C. riders, heading south.  One of them was counting
the number of bikes in our group and then concluded that we too were a
fleche team.  Each group was delighted to see the other, though we
only waved and kept on moving.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Somewhere before Burlington the blue
tandem decided to have another flat (right in front of a heavy equipment
yard with signs posted everywhere that said "Armed Response" (though it
wasn't specified to WHAT they would respond).  Immediately after fixing
the flat, a new flat developed.  This made three flats for the blue
tandem, all in the rear tire of course, which was difficult to remove because
of the disk brake.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Finally the blue tandem was up and
running again, and the team proceeded.  It wasn't long before we noticed
that Pat and Nicole were lagging, however, and we stopped to wait for them
to reach us.  A fatigued looking Pat announced that he and Nicole
were going to drop out.  They said they were quite tired due to the
fact that the disc brake insisted on remaining partially engaged.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Several of us did our best to try
to talk them out of this decision, extolling the virtues of the experience
(great camaraderie, excellent food at the AM-PM stop in Mt. Vernon, beer
and wraps for dinner in Bellingham, great Harold stories in Harrison, you
know - the usual lame reasons - the list went on and on).  None of
this seemed to change Pat's resolve so we finally had to acquiesce and
confess that we had sabotaged his disc brake.  We even agreed to help
disengage the thing.  Once done, we continued on our way (at full
strength - four bikes with sort of o.k. occupants and one bike with very
tired occupants).  Our plan to slow down Pat and Nicole had been a
great success - now they were tired enough to allow the rest of us to keep
up with them.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Arriving at the oasis of the AM-PM
in Mt. Vernon, Genny plopped herself down on the curb, next to the dumpster,
and never moved for the entire break.  She was a study in agony. 
She was so tired that Greg had to take her card in to get it stamped. 
It took a major effort to pull her away from the dumpster and force her
back on the bike.  She screamed as we pried her from the curb and
placed her on the bike; we were firm.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Then we headed out across Skagit Flats,
keeping a civilized pace and moving in unison.  A clearing in the
clouds, the first of the day, was moving in from the southwest.  We
reached Chuckanut Drive in time for a gorgeous sunset out over Puget Sound
and the San Juan islands.  Finally we reached the Motel 6, in Bellingham,
our destination for the day.  We were greeted by Nina Johnson, Lee
Kanning, and Ruth Sneed.  They had wraps and beer waiting for us. 
We also had a grand total of FIVE rooms.  This seemed definitely counter
to the spirit of randonneuring, where a mere ten people hardly warranted
even two motel rooms!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    By consensus (eight to two - the tyranny
of democracy) the dining took place in the Himschoot/Wright room. 
All the other rooms were inhabited by couples and they didn't want their
environment to become littered with empty beer bottles ... or perhaps they
didn't want their environment littered with Ron or Duane.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    It was after her first beer that Genny
casually announced that she would NOT be riding, the next day, because
of her cold.  Several of us jumped her to pry beer number two from
her hands.  Others suggested, however, that she be allowed to drink
several more beers, it then would be easier to talk her into finishing
the ride.  It was not until after we promised her that she could have
the remaining beers for breakfast, IF she agreed to continue, that she
did so.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    We awoke at 1:30 and were rolling
by about 2:15.  Along the Mt. Baker highway we encountered a closure
due to an accident.  They detoured us around the scene, which involved
making a huge descent, then reclimbing - just what we needed.  At
the border the guard asked Ron Himschoot "is this part of an organized
ride?"  How do you answer a question like that?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    At this point in the ride we were
somewhat disoriented because it was not raining.  In the fleches of
the previous two years it had always rained the entire way from Bellingham
to Harrison Hot Springs.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    We continued along in the quiet, predawn
hours.  Eventually the birds started coming to life.  By 6:00
a.m. we were in Chilliwack.  We stopped in to a convenience store
to have our cards stamped (for the 22:00 hour mark).  The clerk was
intrigued by this group of early rising cyclists.  Genny ventured
to explain our purpose.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    Eventually we made it to Harrison
Hot Springs.  Harold Bridge was to be found, along with lots of recently
arrived riders, in a chalet behind the Harrison Hotel.  It was great
to see all of the other teams.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>    The soak in the hot springs, followed
by the banquet and awards ceremony, put us all in great spirits. 
The sensible members of our group spent that night at the Harrison Hotel. 
The rest of us drove back.  I didn't want to go back so soon - I tried
to talk the Sneeds into letting me spend the night in their room, at the
Harrison Hotel, insisting that we were all one big, happy family. 
For some reason they wanted to be alone - families can be like that.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>This could be the start of something big.</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The verdict is in, Seattle IR's (SIR) Inaugural Fleche
was a resounding success with six teams, five local and one from Portland,
OR participating.  Thirty two hungry people showed for the banquet
in Wenatchee.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The weather goddess cooperated and everyone had a good
time if not a learning experience.  Teamwork was the theme and even
the veteran hot shoes got into the spirit.  With each team responsible
for devising its own route they were master of their destiny.  Starting
times and routes were diverse, from 6 PM Friday on White Pass to 9 am Saturday
in Wenatchee and offered interesting results.  Some careful analysis
by the Sigmund Freud Institute might yield the rationale of starting on
a 4,100 foot pass at midnight with potential below freezing temperatures
and serious wind chill factor.  One team reported water bottles freezing
when crossing a mountain pass at night.  At least one rider is indebted
to his trusty emergency space blanket.  Some battled headwinds while
others sailed along with wind on their backsides.  Most traveled about
200 miles before succumbing to sleep however one team cought Z's mid way,
finishing refreshed.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The SIR SuperTeam perennial trophy was won by "Terry's
Team Supreme and Rick."  This year the award went for coming closest
to the minimum distance of 360 KM.  Terry's team had a target of 364
KM and actual ridden distance of the same.  Novice randonneurs outnumbered
the veterans and two teams were complete rookies.  Ken Carter received
a special award for being the first team to enter the Inaugural SIR Fleche.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>SIR Fleche brevet report:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>by Nat Ersoz</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I had no real plans to do this ride.  My road bike
is "up on blocks", and the concept of a team ride makes me nervous. 
Having others rely on me, and having to keep up with other riders' pacing
can be a burden.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Well anyhow, almost without any effort on my part, the
ride organizer John Wagner offers me a bike to ride and pulls together
a 3 rider team out of thin air.  We are now Fleche team "Limited Edition". 
Wednesday evening I drive to John's house (out in Seattle proper) and swap 
my saddle and pedals onto his bike.  I take it home and prepare for
the Fleche.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Saturday morning, 5:30AM.  I asked John to give me
a wake up call before he left home.  This was a good idea.  I'm
awake, but still in bed  listening to the clock radio, when he calls. 
This forces me up.  30 minutes until he gets here.  We meet near
a Starbucks and are off to Wenatchee, driving 145 miles.  Now this
is not really in the "spirit" of the Fleche.  Wenatchee is the end-point,
and we are driving to it, we'll unpack, meet our other team mate (Guy Oldfield)
and start a long circle out into the sage-brush desert.  Most of the
other teams are starting out and heading toward Wenatchee.  But we
are a last minute team, and John as ride organizer has junk that only a
van can carry (like trophy, certificates, etc.)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Off we go, a little after 9AM into the east with a moderate
headwind.  We have 24 hours to complete our route of 233 miles (360K
minimum).  I feel like crap.  Not a good way to start a ride. 
My stomach is all nerves.  A bad week at work just prior, added to
this idea of keeping up with strong riders is making me feel like deflated
cheeze-whiz.  The ride is mostly flat (at least compared to western
WA) and the start is truly flat.  After 20 miles or so, Guy mentions
that there is a hill coming up.  He lives in Richland which is in
eastern WA.  Yup, a long haul hill emerges.  Looooong. 
John rides bigger gears than I do.  I never counted the rear sprocket,
but it was either a 21 or 23 max.  I ride a 26 in back.  So we
slog up the hill.  Guy, smarter than either of us, has  a triple
which I completely envy.  I'm slogging ~50 cadences up this grind. 
John is in the same gears and same pace.  Lots of trading standing
and sitting.  I'd like to stand more, but my energy levels feel rather
low - especially this early in the ride.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We get to the top, and they are not much earlier to the
top than I was - which relieves my one fear that they would be stopped
at the top of each hill waiting on me.  That would be miserable. 
Well, here we are on top of a plateau, in a place called Quincy - I think. 
Not far from the first control, which is ours to create.  We find
a grocery and get our cards signed.  I buy some pears and water for
the road.  Man, I'm sucking down water.  24 oz each 15 miles. 
Which is my typical for a 90-100 degree day in humid Indiana.  Not
a 45 degree morning in dry desert.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At this first stop I raise the saddle nearly an inch,
which helps greatly.  My left leg was getting rather cranky about
seat position.  Our second control is Ephrata, only 17 miles from
the first, and flat.  The next leg of the trip is a long one. 
The cue card today is very simple.   Only 7 entries.  Typically
20-50 miles in length.  Guy says that even the jackrabbits and rattlesnakes
carry camel backs out here.  I top off my two over-sized water bottles
and pack a third bottle into my jersey.  There is not much civilization
until the next control.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I have little notion about where we are.  Basically,
we're in a desert.  We start again, and this time the ride enters
wide open plains as we head north.  To the west you can still see
the beginning of the Cascades.  To the east, it looks like something
out of "High Plains Drifter", and here we are the good, bad and ugly -
on bikes.  North hombre...  This is a long leg of the trip; we
start serious pace-lining and we're cranking for the upper-teens, low-twenties. 
We do this non-stop, with loong rollers and a good tail wind.  As
we are out there riding the western desert, one of the other Fleche teams
passes us in the other direction.  That was really cool.  There
they were nicely lined up, sun-glasses on, riding smooth and silent until
we all wave and yell "hello".  Wow.  I wonder if we look that
cool?</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The next control is Brewster, which doesn't offer much
except Texaco.  We fill bottles, get the brevet card signed and head
off to Pateros where John says there is a diner.   6 miles. 
6 difficult miles, and this puts our daily mileage at 130.  I feel
miserable.  Perhaps some good food will help.  I'm in luck, I
can get some mashed potatoes here and some corn.  Mashed potatoes
have worked wonders in the past for me.  Mid-way through the potatoes,
I'm in the bathroom puking up water, and yechh - all else.  Mostly
water.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I go back to the table and announce that I'm done with
the ride.  John patiently coaches me through this.  We rest some
more here, and I push down the remains of my meal.  It tastes good,
but my stomach has been way off from the start.  Finally, I agree
to give it a go, feeling like a toddler not wanting to go to school. 
John and Guy let me hang on the back for the next 30 miles.  Its dark
now.  Lights are on, I'm zeroed in on John and Guy's tail-lights. 
Somewhere in here, John mentions that we have some 4500 ft of climbing
in so far.  Hah, so much for flat.  Though, in truth, it wasn't
bad - nothing too steep, just long.  The good news is with the night,
the head winds are dying off, we have done most of our climbing - and it's
a net downhill into Wenatchee from here.  I'm starting to feel stronger. 
After 30 miles of being a complete slug and letting the other 2 guys carry
me, I feel the best I've been all day.  Though everything kind of
aches, I'm sure that the strength is there to finish.  That sort of
confidence had eluded me from the start.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Miles slowly melt away.  Around 10PM, my batteries
die in the headlight and we stop.  The CatEye micro-halogen is 
a "Chinese Puzzle" says Guy, as we try to remember how it opens. 
After fumbling around, we get it open.  Farm dogs arrive and bark
around my front tire.  Out of the darkness comes another brevet team,
closely spaced.  We call out a greeting and the farm dogs take off
after them (heh, heh).  We continue on.  The star display this
evening is spectacular.  A good night for UFO sightings.  3 guys
out in the desert on bicycles, delusional, abducted by aliens - you know
how it goes.  Gotta find some beer and pickup.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The next control, is a closed Texaco station.  Ouch. 
We sign our own cards, and John's light runs out of battery juice. 
Fortunately, Guy was lugging 4 extra D cells and lets John have them. 
Holy cow, nothing like carrying a few extra pounds in the pack.  We
grind on to the next open gas station which is a Shell.  We buy 
potato chips and rest.  Just 12 miles to Wenatchee.  A mere morning
commute, I tell myself.  Seems like a lot of climbing to get there. 
Small hills loom large.  We pull into Wenatchee with 197 miles on
the computer.  It is 1AM.  Time for a quick shower, sleep, and
then 38 miles in the morning.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We shower off the salt and hit the sack in the hotel. 
I sleep great.  Twice that night, I get up.  After the second
trip to the bathroom, I fall asleep (3AM) and the phone rings (wake up
call 5AM).  That was the shortest 2 hours of my life.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5:30 AM, we are back on the road with ferocious headwinds. 
We have 19 miles out and 19 back.  We have 3:30 to do it in. 
Butt-bones, neck, back and shoulder blades are sore.  We pedal out
with great effort as the wind literally picks up  gravel, sand and
stones and whips them into our faces.  I should have my glasses on,
but I don't.  We are eating dirt.  This is rough.  The canyon
walls help to both channel the wind into our face and sometimes block the
wind.  We steadily pace-line north to Entiat.  We are there about
7AM and the wind dies down.  Just one hill on the way out.  There
is another Texaco here for a sag, we go in and talk with the locals.  
I have a roast beef sandwich for breakfast.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I am so sick of GU and Clifshot.  There mere thought
of GU makes me wretch.  I have got to get used to eating "real food"
on rides.  At the first control John was tearing apart a fried chicken. 
I need to add protein and salt to the ride diet.  Should make the
rides more fun, too.  So anyhow, the roast beef was great, felt great,
tasted great.  We got back on the bikes at 7:30.  19 miles to
go and guess what, the headwinds that died  have now changed direction
and we've got more headwinds.  They pick up with the rising sun, and
grow worse as the day wears on.  Time to crank.  We push out
with reckless abandon, well into the 20's, trying to beat the headwinds
- and the clock - home.  We spent too much time in Texaco.  Pace-line
city, very nice.  About mid-point our efforts have definitely paid
off.  We are going to make the 9AM deadline, and the winds are really
picking up.  9 miles to go, 40 minutes to do it in.  No problem. 
Lots of wind howling through the canyon now.  We finally reach Wenatchee
and a very gentle grade into town becomes a climb in lowest gear. 
We arrive at  the Wenatchee West Coast hotel with 5 minutes to spare,
237 miles total.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Now we can party.  John heads for a soak in the hot-tub. 
I shower  and find the Washington State wine staying in the room to
allow access for riders from other teams who would like a shower. 
The team from Portland, OR is 2 hours late.  What an adventure they
had.  These guys did the "true" Fleche, starting in their hometown,
riding all the passes and gorges from Portland to Wenatchee.  They
were cold up one pass, found some guys panning for gold who had a bonfire
going.  They warmed up with these fellows and got going again. 
True adventure -truly absolutely "out-there".  Western cowboys on
ponies of steel.  Yeehah.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The banquet room boasts a very nice brunch of eggs, sausage,
bacon, ham, French toast, fruit, and yogurt.  I notice that the eggs
and meat are in high demand.  Not too many vegetarians here. 
I was kind of expecting more.  We're eating carved up pig - and lots
of it.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This was another peg up the cycling ladder for me. 
Another example of how low one can go, and bounce back.  I'm happy
to have made it and it taught me well.  A coaching point for weaker
riders:  Never under-estimate the power of getting back on the bike
and letting someone suck wheel for a few hours.  As long as they are
eating and drinking, they can probably make it--I did.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>And there ya go.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>New Mantra</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  With the easy rides behind and the tougher ones
just ahead consider using a mantra when on a difficult climb.  You’ll
be pleasantly surprised how quickly time passes when in a Zen like state
of repetition.  The following is not just a poem but a statement of
substance.  Try it!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>  In the book "Seven Summits" I came across R. Kipling’s
poem "IF".</FONT>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=-1>If you can dream -- and not make dreams your master</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=-1>If you can think -- and not make your thoughts your

<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Basic Skills Class</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  PBP is just over a year away, this suggestion
may be premature but it certainly can’t hurt.  One of my most vivid
memories of the PBP experience was starting at night with 1,200 other randonneurs. 
The pre-start queue and then first hours of riding forces you into an elbow
to elbow wheels overlapped state at 30 KPH.  If you have never ridden
in a tight peloton or have reason to doubt your bike handling skills in
tight quarters consider taking the basic skills track coarse out at the
Marymoor Velodrome. You will learn the skills needed to survive if not
enjoy the bumping and maneuvering in tight group riding.  I have only
heard rave comments from the people who have taken the track class. 
Culturally, Americans are use to lots of space where the Europeans are
"In your face" and develop much more competent bike handling skills. 
I’m sure you can endure the start of PBP if you don’t take the classes
but why not enjoy the tight pack of riders and add to your skills inventory.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Ps.  This class is free to women.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>From my Swedish Connection</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  In PBP 95 I choose to start in the 84 h group
(05.00).  I have never regretted this and will be choosing the same
time next year (if available).  We had our hotel just a few km from
the start and had persuaded the hotel to serve breakfast at 03.00. 
It all worked out very well.  We could easily have slept another 30-45
min, we were absolutely first at the starting gate.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  In the first day I rode to Carhaix (517 km in
23 h) before sleeping 2 hours. then I rode to Tinteniac (846 km) where
I rested a luxurious 6 h 40 min.  Then all the rest of the ride the
next day. Total time just under 67 hours.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  The 84 hour group is perfect if you are a "fast"
rider.  You will soon start to catch up with stragglers from the 90
h group.  It is a great moral booster to know that you have so far
ridden 7 hours faster than they have.  The only checkpoint with any
kind of a queue was Loudeac.  Here the pace of many 90 hour and 84
hour riders seemed to collide.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Fleche Velo California</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Eight teams participated in the first ever "Fleche
Velo California" this past weekend.  A total of 42 riders from all
over California enjoyed tolerable, considering what El Nino has allowed
to date, weather conditions for the one-way 400+ km ride from Redding,
CA to Davis, CA.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  The "eye" of the cold and blustery storm followed
the seemingly charmed riders throughout the daylight part of the ride. 
Scattered showers and pockets of hail were light and mostly went unnoticed
due primarily to favorable tailwinds.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  With a 100% completion rate, congratulations are
in order for all teams.  It was more than just interesting to observe
the careful attention to the rules and procedures surrounding this new,
for the U.S. at least, randonneuring event.  In fact, there were cases
of near heroism in keeping some teams rolling and finally finishing. 
John Watkins is high on my list of heroes.  You may hear some more
from him about this event.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  DBC organizers are busy comparing notes and getting
ready for the next Fleche Velo California.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Congratulations again to all riders and thanks

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>April 4th - 41 riders showed up for SIR's 200 Km brevet. 
The event was a resounding success due to the riders determined effort
on a demanding route, the hard work of brevet organizer Max Maxon and her
band of volunteers LeAnn Hoffmann and Scott Mar (Stillwater Store control);
Becky Rush and Dave Hohmann (secret control) and last but not least to
chef Rick and CEO Julie Hippe for their gracious hospitality and great
post ride social/feed.  What a difference zero precipitation makes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>With the 200 Km brevet just completed and the Fleche NW
team event close in tow, many new randonneurs are participating in both
April events.  Manyard Hershon's recent article, "A Nation of Loners",
in the March 1998 issue of the Bicycle Paper discusses his observations
are which are appropriate with our new members.  The Bicycle Paper
is free at better Seattle bicycling shops or is accessible on the Web at 
<A HREF="http://www.bicyclepaper.com/">www.bicyclepaper.com</A></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Maynard probes into an open wound characteristic of many
bicycle clubs that fail the test of time.  Below are a few excerpts
from "A Nation of Loners".  Please read the complete Bicycle Paper
article.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>A Nation of Loners</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>BY MAYNARD HERSHON</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Last month I said: A club is defined by its treatment
of new and "slower" riders.  I believed that when I wrote it, but
now I believe it more than ever.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>In January; I visited friends in New Zealand.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Peter, who is strong enough to hang with the fast rides,
rode with the new riders.  He made sure they stayed together, that
they learned something about group cycling and that everyone had a good
time.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the jobs to be filled was that of a "shepherd"
who would start with the fast guys, then hang back and stay with dropped
riders.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>He or she would try to keep those riders together so
they, too, would have a "group" experience - instead of the lonely return
ride we've all endured.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>My experiences in England and N.Z., plus stories I've
heard about Canadian cycling, lead me to believe that we've become (or
always were) a nation of loners.  We look out for number one.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>We see others as threats, not potential friends. 
Hey; who needs friends?  Who's got time?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Ride here, and you think that's the way of the world.
Ride elsewhere and realize you were wrong.</FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1> <A NAME="PTDC"></A><B> PAC Tour Desert Camp</B></FONT></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1> Now that I have joined SIR and IR this season,
I have wondered how I would train, eat properly and learn techniques as
an ultra-marathon cyclist.  My goal, along with many others in the
IR, is to qualify, register and finish Paris-Brest-Paris in 1999.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   I surfed the Internet looking for news groups
(technically, majordomo@cycling.org) related to long distance endurance
cycling.  I subscribed to two news groups, "RANDON" and "ULTRA". 
Lon Haldeman from Pacific-Atlantic-Cycling (PAC) Tour posted a message
regarding an ultra-marathon endurance training camp.  The training
camp would be held in the high dessert of Tucson Arizona during the month
of February.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Lon quickly responded to my e-mail questions. 
After researching PAC Tour, Lon Haldeman and Susan Notorangelo, I realized
this was an opportunity I could not pass up.  Since 1980, both have
been organizing long distance cycling events, along with over twenty (20)
wins in races across America and setting records in twelve (12) of these
wins.  In addition, both have set Paris-Brest-Paris records. 
Their credentials (not all listed here) proved that they have "walked the
talk".</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Moreover, Pete Penseyres, veteran racer and
member of the 1996 Bicycling Magazine RAAM [Race Across AMerica] 50+ team
which set a record for both the Master's Division and for teams; 
John Hughes, newly appointed Director of the Ultra-Marathon Cycling Association,
RAAM winner, ultra-marathon  coach;  Mike Wilson, veteran ultra-marathon
cyclist, 1997 RAAM 50+ solo winner and winner of the 1997 RAAM Rookie of
the Year;  Warren McNaughton, veteran long distance endurance cyclist
and multiple P-B-P finisher;  and Ed Burke from the Olympic 
Training Center would be at Desert Camp to lead seminars and ride with
us every day.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   John Wagner, along with my long time cycling
friends, have asked me to produce a journal of my activities and learning
experiences while at Desert Camp.  I decided the best way to present
my information was to organize the article with a synopsis, summary and
finally, a detailed section.  Those finding that the synopsis and
summary fulfill their interest can move on to another article.  And
those desiring more information can find it in the next issue of the SIR
Newsletter.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>SYNOPSIS of Desert Camp</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   PAC Tour's Desert experience consisted of
two weeks.  Week #1 begins with Desert Camp and the following week
with Desert Tour.  This type of venue presented many options for riders
to choose either or both to accomplish their personal goals for this season. 
The cost of any PAC Tour includes lodging in hotels (based on double occupancy),
breakfast, lunch and snacks.  Dinners were the rider's responsibility.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Desert Camp consisted of six days of riding
and fly-in/fly-out to/from Tucson on Day #1 and Day #7.  Riding begins
on Day #2, departing Tucson traveling to Sierra Vista (approximately 85
miles), the base hotel for the remainder of the week (Day #2 - Day #6).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   The daily Desert Camp schedule was as follows:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>6:30 AM - 7:00 AM      
Stretching</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>7:00 AM - 8:00 AM      
Hot buffet breakfast</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>8:30 AM - 2:00 PM      
Daily rides (varied from 50 - 100 miles)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>2:30 PM - 3:30 PM      
Optional Time: Physical testing, Computrainer Races, Massages, Stretching</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>3:30 PM - 5:00 PM      
Instructional seminars</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>5:00 PM - 7:00 PM      
Dinner (on your own)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>7:00 PM - 9:00 PM      
Special presentations</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The schedule was adjusted whenever weather or road conditions
prevented the majority of riders from finishing before 3:30 PM.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Desert Tour, Week #2, consisted of seven
days of riding and fly-in/fly-out on Day #1 and Day #9.  Each day
of the Tour was point-to-point as opposed to Camp where each day was a
loop.  Daily mileage of Desert Tour ranged from 65 - 105 miles per
day.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Summary of Desert Camp</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Desert Camp is NOT FOR THE WEAK AT HEART. 
The Tucson - Sierra Vista areas RECORDED extreme weather conditions in
low temperatures, wind speeds, wind gusts, rain and snow.  Daily rides
took riders up to the 5,000'+ elevation, not once but twice and sometimes
three.  The daily elevation gains ranged from 2,500' to 4,000+'.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Both, Lon Haldeman and Susan Notorangelo
organized a great program with a solid theme for each day.  Pete Penseyres,
Mike Wilson, Warren McNaughton, John Hughes and Ed Burke all had advice
to offer to improve each rider's long-distance endurance cycling career. 
They talked with the riders during the instructional seminars, special
presentation, breakfast, dinner, and on the rides.  When I arrived
at Desert Camp, I did not know what to expect but everyone made me feel
relaxed and at ease.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   What amazed me was that everyone was so humble,
something I never expected, but appreciated with each passing day. 
Mike Wilson, 1997 RAAM Rookie of the Year and Solo Winner of 50+ year old
division, patiently answered every question and only offered his opinion
when asked.  And offered his ideas of what worked for him in his RAAM
training and RAAM.  His liquid food mix was awesome.  I liked
it and began to depend on it during the rides.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Harold Trease has qualified for RAAM and
has begun his training for this season RAAM at Desert Camp.  My thoughts
of a RAAM rider were changed during Camp.  The ultra-marathon cyclist
is a different but humble breed.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   I had a difficult time adjusting to the 4,500'
altitude of the Sierra Vista area.  It took about three days of acclimatizing
to where I was not gasping for air when I pushed hard.  Drinking (while
riding) was another altitude related problem.  It required me to hold
my breath in order to swallow which left me with the sensation of drowning,
gasping to recover.  This cycle was repeated over and over. 
Drinking on the descents or at the end of a pace line was the optimum time
to take fluids.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   I also spent most segments of the rides by
myself because I had a difficult time staying with the "faster" pace lines. 
The "fast" pace lines were riders in the 50+ year old age range. 
Some of which, were training for the Senior Olympics, Senior Championships
or just getting in their 12,000 miles for the year.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Mother Nature (could we blame this on El
Nino?) just happened to set records as eluded to earlier.  Because
of the low temperatures, my legs were always covered during Desert Camp
and thus never saw daylight.  Each day presented us with a new set
of riding techniques to adjust for the weather and terrain.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   On Day #4, as I opened the hotel door to
walk to breakfast, I heard loud snapping noises.  As I turned around
to investigate I saw the flags whipping and snapping in the wind. 
Some riders rode the SAG vehicle to the first rest stop at 25.5 miles. 
Those that rode felt the head winds and severe side gusts which took them
from one side of the rode to the other.  It took me about five hours
to travel the 40.5 miles to lunch.  I recall approaching a hill as
I was riding into head winds, I stood to climb and almost fell off my bike
because the cyclo-computer showed a speed of zero.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Also that same day, a rider was flipped over
on her bike [while on her aero bars] by a side gust.  She suffered
a stretched anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her left shoulder. 
She learned the hard way about not using the aero bars in severe wind conditions. 
She was unable to ride the next day, so she jogged up to the top of Mule
Pass!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Day #5 was a climbing day.  Ascend and
descend Mule Pass (elevation 5,860') then head toward Tombstone with more
climbing.  Weather conditions were 35 F, snow level below 5,000',
with a little mist at the start.  On the way up to Mule Pass, snow
was falling and sticking to the road.  The descent back down with
winds, wet roads and low temperatures made for hazardous conditions. 
Reaching Tombstone we were greeted with snow flurries.  The local
actors dressed in their Wild West attire were good enough not to ask us
to stay for their 1:00 PM show re-enacting of the "Shoot Out at the OK
Coral".  They said to keep moving ... out of Tombstone because of
the snow conditions.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   During dinner one evening, I talked with
Mike Wilson in great detail about nutrition for ultra-marathon events,
in particular RAAM.  Mike said that the most important factor was
to maintain a constant intake of calories to keep your system fueled up. 
Liquid food is a key factor in ultra-marathons and brevets.  His sustained
RAAM performance was due primarily to the mixture of MLO Mus-L-On II and
Energy Surge (equal portions) mixed with water supplemented with solid
food when time permitted.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   MLO/Energy Surge mixture of three scoops
[62 or 67 cc, whatever is in the MLO container] per small water bottle
or four scoops per large water bottle.  This provided an estimated
400 calories per water bottle.  The concentration can be varied depending
on the weather conditions.  More water and less food for hot conditions
and more food and less water for cold conditions.  Liquid food does
not replace the need for fluids, intake of fluids must still be maintained.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Moreover, Energy Surge can also be used by
itself.  It is very easy on the stomach and the taste buds. 
Energy Surge is almost tasteless and Mike uses it alone quite often.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Since returning to Seattle from Desert Camp,
I have been looking for a source of MLO Mus-L-On II.  MLO has discontinued
manufacturing of Mus-L-On II.  The General Nutrition Center (GNC)
carries the MLO Mus-L-Blast 2000 powder which tastes similar to Mus-L-On
II.  I experimented on the 200 Km Snoqualmie brevet this last Saturday,
4/4/98, using only MLO and water mixture.  I consumed a large water
bottle every 1.5 hours or whenever I felt my stomach getting empty. 
Five minutes after taking the liquid food, I was back to normal output.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   Lon Haldeman introduced me to Malto-dextrin
(the powder form).  When mixed with your favorite electrolyte drink,
it adds approximately 150 - 200 calories per water bottle.  Malto-dextrin
is a tasteless potato starch and most commonly used in the brewing of beer. 
Almost all energy gel contains Malto-dextrin.  During Desert Camp,
I used two ladles [equivalent of two cups] of Malto-dextrin with just water
in a tall water bottle.  In order to mix it with water, put the Malto-dextrin
in the bottle first then add water, shake vigorously and top off with water.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   In Seattle, I have experimented with Gatorade
[half strength] and between 1.75 - 2 cups of Malto-dextrin.  I found
an endless [for now] supply at the Liberty Malt Supply Company located
at 1419 First Avenue, Seattle WA 98101.  They can be reached at 206-622-1880. 
I also used the Gatorade/Malto-dextrin in conjunction with Mus-L-Blast
2000 on the recent brevet.  During the brevet I did not have any solid
foods with the exception of a banana that I ate even though I was not hungry.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>   I hope this information is useful. 
I will continue with a detailed description of each day's activity at Desert
Camp in the next issue of SIR Rides Again.</FONT>

Populaire - View From The Back of The Pack</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>By: E. "Max" Maxon</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a dark and stormy night -- well, okay, it was a
gray and potentially stormy day.  Twenty-three cyclists showed up
in Newport Hills and looked nervously at the clouds, grumbling a little
about where is that sunshine, anyway.  Two cyclists decided to go
hiking instead.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The fearless ride organizer showed up, made everyone sign
their lives away on the dotted line of ride sign-in sheets, and led the
pack  out of the Newport Hills Neighborhood.  Well, actually
got dropped by most all of the 21 cyclists only  blocks from her house
-- but continued the ride from the back anyways.  Out May Valley Road,
past the horses in fields, the riders were nervously looking at the skies
for signs of deluge.  But none came.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Max rode with Harkleroad and Himschoot, both trying to 
outdo each other in pfaffing points, telling jokes and being thoroughly
enjoyable riding partners before Max gasped still further to the very back
of the pack.   Wheezing a little, the light-lunged brevet leader
stopped at the bottom of Tiger Mountain for an inhaler puff, whereupon
she met up with Debra Lowe's Joe, fighting the eternal self-loosening fender
problem.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Joe started up Tiger Mountain and Max followed, 
gasping her way to the top.  Meanwhile, Bob-The Whiz- Wisznewski turned
around and rode part way down, so as to provide support. The Whiz was there
at the top when Max waved at the big truck  firefighters of Tiger
Mountain Fire Station, and they let the siren wail!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The sun  peeked out and the descent validated the
ascending gasps  on Tiger Mountain.  At the bottom, The Whiz
and Max met up with Jesse, a bold triathlete in training, who had stopped
to dust her bike (sitting unused since September?) and check the route
map.  They  proceeded  Musketeer style, commenting on the
yellow submarine, dead possum and damnable (for some) thin-aired rolling
hills.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Out Tanaskett Loop, Max noted a mud puddle deep enough
to sink a truck, while Bob-The-Whiz practiced one-leg peddling style. 
Jessie just hung on, then peeled off at the Ravensdale store so as not
to miss her ride home!  Speaking of peeling, Rick The Hipster was
seen blazing the road home so as not to miss a family event.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Hail hit just before Black Diamond.  Max and the
Whiz happily joined their compatriots inside the Black Diamond bakery. 
Marionberry pie, latte's  and sandwiches disappeared.  Debra
No-Gears and Joe were found discussing the eternal self-loosening fender
solution, and Messrs. Himschoot and Harkleroad added their spry remarks
to the lunchtime conversation.  A few straggled out too soon for the
return, and shortly thereafter, it began to hail -- hard!</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Leaving the bakery was tough, but those who did were rewarded
with the end of hail and some sunshine on the ride home.  A brief
stop at the Tapatio's Mexican Restaurant afterwards found SIR newcomers
Wayne Methner and first timers Ken Condray, Sandy Konczak and Bob Wiszniewski
happily eating burritos and/or loosening their leg muscles with margaritas. 
Ken Brooker put in a goodbye appearance, and told stories of new lands.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All in all, a good time was had at the back of the pack
on that dark and not so stormy day, with a successful afternoon of sunshine
from the back of the pack on SIR's first  100 km.</FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>By Pat Roden</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>March 1998</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Kristy, my wife, and Jaime, our two-year-old just returned
from spending a few weeks in Southern France and the Spanish Island of
Majorca.  Both areas offered incredible cycling opportunities and
I thought you might want to know about them for a future cycling vacation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Normally, Kristy and I wouldn’t consider going to Europe
this early in the year but our little girl was fast approaching the age
of the purchased ticket so we thought it might be good timing for us and
we would simply have to take a chance on the weather.  Typically the
weather in Southern France and Spain is pretty good this time of year,
sunny and temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees.  However, they can
get anything from 40 to 80 with rain and/or wind.  The Gods shined
down on us though and it ended up working out just fine.  We never
saw another rain drop after we leaving Seattle until we returned again
at Seatac airport.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We arrived in Toulouse, France and stayed with French
friends for a couple days.  Their daily lives are much different from
ours.  Work typically begins about 9:00 am and every day they arrive
home at noon for a 2 to 3 hour lunch break.  The first lunch they
served us was pork chops, a nicoise salad, vegetables, and potatoes served
with plenty of wine.  This was followed up with a cheese course and
desert.  The next day was along the same lines. They swore they do
this every day.  Then it’s back to work about 3:00pm and finally returning
home about 5:30 PM for dinner.  Although our friends are schoolteachers
and admit they have as easy of schedule as anyone in France they still
profess that many French people follow a similar schedule.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second night we were in France we visited the family
of the girl that stayed with us last summer, Caroline.  Her Mother
had us at the dinner table for a very traditional French meal lasting over
four hours.  She and her family were very friendly and gracious hosts.
Relationships and time spent with family and friends are very important
with most of the French people that I have come into contact with. 
They may not have the latest cars, they may have smaller homes, but it
is very hard to argue that their quality of life suffers in any way because
of this.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After a short visit in Toulouse our friends escorted us
on the two-hour drive to the town of Argeles sur Mer near the French/Spanish
border where they set us up in their ‘beach’ cottage.  This was a
very cozy two bedroom, two bathroom house in an old neighborhood. 
Out on the patio the Mimosa trees were in complete bloom, the olive trees
were leafed out, and the spring flowers were starting to pop out. Spring
in Southern France was in full bloom.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After saying goodbye to our friends we settled in for
the next five days.  Since I didn’t bring my own bicycle to Europe
I quickly located a bike shop that rents bicycles.  My first experience
was rather disappointing.  I entered what appeared to be a very nice
shop, extremely well outfitted and asked to rent a velo route – a road
bike.  They then went over and pulled a heaping piece off the wall
with back wheel an inch out of true and no rear tire.  I politely
declined and traveled to the next shop where I rented a reasonable quality
VTT (mountain bike) for a whopping $ 10 per day.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The first ride was an evening warm-up 20k ride up a single
lane road through some vineyards into a small gorge like valley with a
small river and a number of waterfalls.  It was very peaceful. 
Along the way was a sign pointing toward a roman road or footpath from
100 BC which could have easily been built just 20 years ago.  Seemingly
a turn to the left or a turn to the right leads to some interesting natural
or historical site almost anywhere in southern France.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Considering I had about 200 miles of riding in since last
summer the next day became the ‘big’ ride.  Our friends from Toulouse
had saved an issue of a French cycling magazine with suggested routes in
the local area so I pretty much used the routes that the article suggested
as a basis for my rides in the area.  The ‘big’ ride turned out to
be a 100-km ride starting at sea level and traversing to the top of a col
or pass at 660 meters.  The ride initially reminded me of PBP because
I would be on these winding country roads which would climb up into a small
village and then quickly exit the village and be back on a country road
before I knew it.  This time of year the vineyards are just starting
to bud and the trees are not completely filled out but it is still very
pretty.  This day as most of them were, was very nice.  Lots
of sun and temperatures around 65 F.  The last 30K leading up into
the Pyrenees and the Col Fortou was along a single lane asphalt road with
a small village every 10k or so.  A car might pass every 5 or 10 kms.
But all in all it was very quiet, very relaxing, and quite scenic.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The third and final ride I was able to do in the area
was a ride they called the Tour de Madaloc.  A very short 15km ride
from sea level to approximately 2,500 feet.  This ride was nothing
less than incredible.  You start at the very historic and beautiful
village called Coulour and begin climbing to a mountain peak called the
Tour de Madaloc.  All the time you are climbing the road gradually
steepens until I finally had to get off my bike near the top when the road
was approaching a 30 percent grade.  You have a fantastic view of
a number of incredible villages, the Pyrenees mountains, and the Mediterranean
sea.  The French cycling magazine actually recommended climbing to
this particular point by three different roads and making a longer day
out of it but once was more than enough for me.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The next day we drove south an hour and a half into Barcelona
where we caught a quick 30-minute flight to the island of Majorca. 
We were traveling to the Stephen Roche cycling camp that I had read about
in a couple magazines last year.  It seemed almost too good to be
true; excellent support, awesome riding, great weather, a 4 star hotel,
most meals, and a chance to meet and ride with Stephen Roche for about 
$ 70 per day.  It proved to be all of this and more.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>When you fly to Majorca you fly into the city of Palma
which was much nicer than I expected.  In general, Spain seems a little
dirty compared to France or Italy but the island of Majorca is much cleaner
than the rest of Spain. It is a fairly wealthy island but in contrast to
somewhere like Hawaii it is relatively inexpensive.  It reminded me
of a cross between Hawaii, France and the California wine country. 
Lush in many ways but also rocky and dry in others.  Temperatures
were between 70 and 75 F. every day with sunshine or light whispy skies.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We arrived at the camp and were given a personal tour
by Margo, a British woman that had been living on the island for 25 years. 
She proved to be a tremendous resource all week, very gracious and helpful. 
Margo explained that on this particular week there would be about 60 people
at the camp with 42 people actually riding.  She also said that this
would be the first week at the camp where the English-speaking people outnumbered
the French-speaking group.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The facilities were very nice.  A large ‘mechanics’
shop where most of the bikes are assembled and maintained, an interior
fenced and locked bike storage area where they had probably 100 secure
bike hangers for everyone including room for your equipment, and finally
a very comfortable lounge and office where they sold jerseys, shorts, etc
and you could hang out and watch a library of cycling videos, read books
and magazines, etc.  The hotel itself was ‘comfortable European’ meaning
the rooms were large for Europe, very clean, and the views of the sea were
very nice.  The location of the hotel is excellent. It was relatively
quiet yet only a couple hundred yards from stores and restaurants. Our
only complaint with the camp was that the quality of dinners was not all
that great.  However, the only people to notice seemed to be the few
Americans.  The English, Irish, and French actually liked the huge
selection of foods even though the quality was probably equivalent to a
‘Kings table buffet’.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Most of the staff was French.  There were 4 ride
leaders, Claude the office manager, Bernard the former French Amateur national
coach and ride support person, Margo, and of course Stephen Roche who lives
in Ireland but arrives at the camp every Friday and departs every Sunday
evening.  All in all a very impressive group.  Two of the ride
leaders are members of French professional teams.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Since I had chosen to rent a bike from the camp instead
of bringing my own they asked me to drop by to be fitted. I arrived down
to the mechanics shop where Philipe, a very interesting and funny ride
leader/mechanic/racer/etc. presented me with a brand new, never before
ridden Stephen Roche bike outfitted with Campy Record and Chorus components. 
Their camp literature had stated that their equipment was new every year
and was of excellent quality and I couldn’t agree more.  The bike
rental was just $10 per day plus another $2 per day for insurance that
would cover any and all damage to the bike.  I tell you this place
was an incredible deal.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the week different ride leaders made comments
about my riding position and I would make slight adjustments accordingly. 
By the end of the week I met with Philipe again where we reviewed my final
riding position and took measurements of everything so that I could make
the appropriate changes to my bike at home.  Basically I learned that
I had the seat much too high, I was riding too small of frame at home,
and I was too far forward.  The timing of all this was pretty good
since my Cannondale frame had a crack and Cannondale agreed to give me
a new frame and fork under warranty.  I simply ordered the next size
up when I replaced the frame.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each day there were 4 groups leaving at 15-minute intervals. 
The recreational group leaving first followed by the average group (my
choice), etc.   Most of the people were either enthusiasts or
racers training for the season.  All of the people were very outgoing
and friendly. All week I spoke with a chap from Ireland, Victor. 
It wasn’t until the end of the week that I found out he was the Wales National
Road Race champion the previous year.  It didn’t seem to matter what
your abilities were, your nationality, etc everyone was treated with respect,
friendliness and openness all week.  It was an excellent group of
people.  There were many English and Welsh, Irish, French, an Italian,
about 4 or 5 Americans, and a couple of Swiss riders at the camp.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Our ride leader was Miguel, a French speaking ex-racer. 
He would keep the pace very, very consistent throughout the rides. 
Out we went the first day for a 60km ride with many, many climbs. 
Leaving the coast you head up an untravelled single lane road that seemed
to be paved the previous day.  It was perfect.  The climbs are
generally only 4 to 5 % grades but the road switches back here and there
through incredible countryside.  We would zip up a climb and see vineyards,
stone fences galore, hundreds of lambs, olive trees, old Majorcan homes
and farms, and small orange and lemon trees with ripened fruit.  It
was scaled perfectly to a cyclist.  I arrived in terrible shape but
the excitement, weather, and people all invigorated me.  After completing
the first ride I was so excited I took Kristy and Jaime out in the car
and we drove the course all over again.  It was beautiful.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second day was 110 km ‘flat’, hard ride day. 
After the previous day it was pretty tough on me but I was able to hang
onto other people’s wheels and survive.  The third day was the only
scheduled ‘rest’ day of the week so I was able to re-coup somewhat before
the ‘Corniche’ ride.  This was a very hilly, hard ride that was approximately
100 km along the very rugged mountainous coastline.  Again the energy
and excitement kept me moving and going along. Up we would ride as a group
through a village and then down the hills we would race.  At one point
I braked hard and my back wheel slid forcing me to ride off the road but
I was able to avoid a couple sizeable rocks.  One of the best riders
in our group was a beautiful Italian woman we started to call Paula Pezzo.
She was always at the front, always pushing the pace, always competing
with everyone in the group.  She didn’t speak anything but Italian
and was the only Italian in the camp so no one could talk with her but
we all had a great time none-the-less.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After the Corniche ride we had a 120 km ‘flat’ ride. 
Everyone went out so hard on the Corniche we were all beat for the hard
flat ride.  The term flat was a joke.  The ride leaders had intentionally
had us believing that the ride for the day would be flat but in reality
we climbed some difficult but very pretty mountains.  One particular
town, Orient, was this incredibly beautiful, very small village placed
way up high in a mountain pass (2000’ feet up).  I drove there later
with Kristy and Jaime and stopped in and asked about room rates at a very
cute little inn.  $ 28 per night per double.  Wow.  Speaking
of reasonable costs one night Kristy and I went out to dinner at a nice
restaurant called Ciros.  It was a warm evening and we sat outside
enjoying the sunset and the beach.  We had this incredible Sangria
de Cava which is like a champagne, white wine served in a huge clear pitcher
with lots of ice and fresh oranges sliced up in it.  Dinner was roast
chicken, potatoes, and vegetables.  The bill including tax and tip
was $ 16 – for both of us.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After the first couple of rides I began to finally grasp
the indelible mark that cycling has upon the island of Majorca.  Palm
Springs, CA has over 100 golf courses.  It is the center of the universe
for golfers.  Majorca has 75,000 cyclists arriving between January
and April with the simple purpose of training and riding for enjoyment. 
Majorca has to be the Palm Springs of cycling.  On any given day we
might see upwards of 1,000 cyclists on the road.  There would be German
or Dutch groups of a hundred cyclists all dressed in the same jerseys,
single groups of individuals, or small groups like our own of 10 to twenty
riders.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On Friday night they had an incredible Majorcan feast
with sangria and a big party.  Stephen Roche arrived at dinnertime
and proceeded to spend the whole dinner talking with each person or small
group of people welcoming them to the camp and talking about cycling in
general.  The next day he joined about twelve of us on a 60km ride
with some pretty tough climbs.  Immediately after leaving the camp
he came alongside me and started chatting away for the next 10 kms telling
me about his family, commenting on Bernard Hinault and Eddie Mercx, telling
me that he became a cyclist originally as an enthusiast and how he felt
that he would continue to ride his bike recreationally for the rest of
his life.  I remember asking him about his ability to speak so many
languages – he spoke French, Italian, Spanish, and some German and he told
me that he picked all of the language skills up in the peloton, never taking
any formal training.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Later in the ride he and another Irish rider broke out
into a couple of Irish songs while we were riding along.  About 10
km from the finish Stephen and I were talking about something not paying
attention to the rest of the group which was a couple hundred yards ahead
of us.  He turned to me and asked how my legs were feeling. 
I remember saying that I felt okay so then he hammers down on the pedals
without standing up and I just watched him start to accelerate away. 
I mean you could see the acceleration. It was all I could do to stay on
his wheel to catch the group.  By the time we caught up I was so redlined
I got dropped again.  Meanwhile I hear Steven start a conversation
with someone and he doesn’t even sound winded.  Give me a break. 
Later he dropped back and pulled me up to the top of the next hill. 
As we approached the outskirts of town he pulled over and waited to ride
in with some of the slower riders.  The man impressed me as a very
intelligent, outwardly friendly and sincere, yet a very humble guy. 
If you met the guy on the street you would never have a clue the guy won
the Tour de France at one point in his career. The whole experience was
somewhat dreamlike.  I definitely came away from the Majorca and the
camp very pleased with the whole experience.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Quite simply my suggestion, if you can afford it, is to
quit your jobs immediately. Move to Majorca, France, or Italy and ride
the beautiful roads each day until you die at a very old and very happy
age.  That’s my dream.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Side Note:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>When we left the Argeles sur Mer area in Southern France
we both thought it was one of the nicest areas we had been in France. 
Kristy and I have now spent some time in many areas of France and we both
really enjoyed this particular area.  So much so that our future plans
for PBP ’99 will probably include spending some time again in this area
before PBP (Majorca is supposedly much too hot and humid in August). 
In fact I am thinking it might be fun to spend the first week in France
traversing the Pyrenees along the Raid Pyrenees route (approximately 700
km) from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea in a kind of pre-PBP ride
and then spending the week before PBP on the Mediterranean shore near Argeles
sur Mer or Coulour relaxing and resting up before taking a train or car
up to Paris for PBP.  The whole trip would be about three weeks. 
If anyone is interested we could discuss the logistics sometime.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Also if anyone is interested I took quite a few slides
of the trip and could show them at an upcoming meeting (assuming they process
out completely).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ken Brooker, a consummate cyclist and old friend (and

and generosity uncommon to our self-indulgent society which brings to mind
the following piece by brother Maynard.</FONT>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Random Acts</FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>Reprinted from "Half-Wheel HELL & Other Cycling
Stories" by Maynard Hershon</FONT></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Adair Lara writes terrific twice-weekly columns in the
San Francisco Chronicle.  Recently, Lara wrote about her friend Anne
Herbert who, in 1983, scribbled these words on a place mat in a Sausalito
restaurant:  "Practice random acts of kindness and senseless acts
of beauty."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Lara says Herbert calls herself a full-time worrier,
that she "sees world history as a clash of hobbies."  Here's Herbert's
explanation.  You should be able figure out why I feel it belongs
in a cycling hobbyist book:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>"Each of us," Herbert says, "has something we just naturally
like to do - making quilts, listening to sermons, shooting guns, creating
model airplanes.  We all tend to think the stuff we really like to
do is way better than a hobby and fact, something everyone should do". 
Much like most cyclists.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Some people do evil acts, according to Herbert, trying
to convert others to their hobby, the hobby "everyone should do." 
Even evil-doers, in their own minds are making the world better."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Instead of simply picking an activity and pursuing it,
Herbert maintains, we become crusaders.  If that's true - and I think
it is - we should pick our hobbies carefully.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>"My hobby;" Herbert says, "is wondering how I could reduce
the net cruelty in the world."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>What an idea: reducing the net cruelty in the world. 
Quite a chore, huh?  It'd take a ton of people and a ton of effort
from each to make a microscopic dent in net global cruelty.  But every
little bit of anti-cruelty helps.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I'd like to suggest you set aside some small percentage
of the energy you normally apply to your cycling hobby and donate it to
Herbert's hobby.  Apply a fraction of the money, sweat, time and persistence
you invest in cycling or personal fitness; to "reducing the net cruelty
in the world."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>How can you do that?  I don't know that I can tell
you how, the same way I can't tell you whom to vote for, or to work for,
or whose records to buy.  You can figure it out for yourself.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Try this:  Imagine yourself practicing random acts
of kindness.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Random acts of kindness.  Say the words out loud. 
Do they bring to mind tender impulses nearly acted upon, gentle or generous
deeds overdue, possibly never to be done?  Sincere compliments unpaid,
gratitude unexpressed, love unreturned, persons unheeded?  You don't
need me to finish this paragraph.  Write your own list.  Use
the back of the page if you run out of room. Use Nevada.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I'm not suggesting you give up riding.  Ride 10
hours . . . and then spend one hour with some one really sick or really
hurt or lonely.  Don't plan it, don't pencil it in, expect anything. 
Make that act the most spontaneous of your day or week.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I'm not suggesting you deny yourself.  Buy that
exotic road bike.  And afterward, go to your ATM, withdraw the equivalent
of 10 percent of the money you paid for the bike, and use the money to
make a difference, however fleeting, in someone's or a few someone's' lives. 
Even if - if you sat and thought about it over a decaf latte - you might
feel they haven't earned your help.  Don't judge them.  Help
Them.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Chances are the differences you make in their lives will
live in your mind longer than will the difference the new bike makes in
your time up Hero Hill.  Perhaps not; help'em anyway.  Remember:
net global cruelty.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Maybe after a while you'll get in the habit of committing
those random acts of Kindness: They'll no longer be all that random. 
To continue, you'll have to let your imagination run wild, conceiving ever
more spontaneous caring acts.  That'd be okay, wouldn't it?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I'm not trying to provoke you to cut short even one brutal
workout or keep you from relentless pursuit of your all-time best kick-ass
form.  No way.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I'm just suggesting that Anne Herbert may have something
here.  Try her hobby, the practice of random acts of kindness, one-10th
of the time you spend at yours, the practice of pursuing personal fitness.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>After all, 10 hours of intervals, cross-training and
gym work will make your legs heavy.  One frivolous hour chipping away
at world cruelty will put wings on your feet. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These new members are driving me crazy with requests. 
The latest is for a serious training rides between our brevets.  I
mentioned some of the rides I enjoy and they were eager to give it a go.
We in the NW are blessed with absolutely stunning cycling terrain. 
I’m proposing a king of the mountain serious that would include such classics
as:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Hurricane Ridge</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Cle Elum - Blewett Pass - Leavenworth and return</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Skykomish - Stevens Pass - Leavenworth and return</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Mt. Rainier - 3 hills (Cayuse, Sunrise and Crystal
Mt.) and the Packwood, Paradise, Skate Creek loop.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Triple Pass - Cayuse, White and Chinook Passes</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>  Other possibilities are a Mt. St. Helens loop
and Newhalem - Mazama mama and return</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you have a favorite kick-ass climb let me know and
we’ll include it, give me some input on dates and we'll get'em scheduled. 
If this series is of interest to you let me know so we can plan accordingly. 
They are planned as informal club rides, bring your pain meter and bragging
rites.  "Bakery Joe" need not apply.</FONT>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="SUTR"></A><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Stepping up to Randonneuring</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This year SIR is blessed with a group of new and enthusiastic
members.  They don’t come with extensive endurance riding experience
much less the variety of unsupported randonneuring style.  Presumably
they do have the resolve to work through the obstacles that inevitably
will challenge each of them.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On the surface our sport of riding hours or days on end
with little sleep, eating crummy food and sitting on what feels like a
2 X 4 may sound romantic (to a few) but more likely appears daunting if
not downright stupid and masochistic.  Take consolation, there is
a method to this apparent madness.  Sitting in a tavern the other
night talking with one of these wide eyed neophyte members brought back
memories of my introduction to cycling and eventually the randonneuring
experience.  I only recount these events because they demonstrate
how small progressive moves can lead to initially unimaginable accomplishments. 
The graduated distance of the brevet series is designed to not only test
muscle and machine but more importantly build confidence and the mental
toughness required to go the distance.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ten years ago I thought it would be truly cool to commute
to work on a bicycle.  The one way distance of 22.5 miles seemed an
imposing if not impossible task.  I first tested the route on a Saturday. 
Leaving home on a 10 speed with no tools or water, I was dressed in jeans
and a T-shirt.  It was a warm summer day in the 80’s.  I made
it to my place of employment but had little left for the return. 
When I did get to within a mile of home I had to stop at a favorite tavern
to resuscitate myself with brew and burger.  As I slumped on the bar
my friends look horrified at my condition but then couldn’t contain their
laughter when I explained what I just did.  I dearly hoped this was
as bad as it would get.  After the 45 mile round trip commute became
common place I looked for more challenge.  Seattle to Portland (STP)
appeared as formidable as that first commute.  Two years of two day
STP’s were followed by the same 190 miles in one day.  Back then you
only whispered the word "RAMROD."  Only cycling Goliath’s were capable
of riding 156 miles and 10 K elevation gain in half a day.  Surprisingly,
I cracked 9 hours in my first RAMROD.  This stuff wasn’t as tough
as your brain lead you to believe.  With each longer and more difficult
ride the confidence built.  I heard of something called Cannonball,
Seattle to Spokane on Hwy. I-90.  Up to this point I had been riding
solo but decided to ask a friend to drive support for me on this one. 
His response was "I don’t want to drive to Spokane much less support your
ass on a skinny tire bicycle."  This turned out to be a godsend making
me more determined to ride the 295 miles unsupported.  It was a great
ride with a big tail wind, the heat not much over 90 and I made a lot of
new and strange friends.  The goal was to finish before dark and I
beat the sunset by 4 hours.  I was beginning to figure this stuff
out.  The following year a new ride "S2S" was introduced.  Seattle
to Spokane on Hwy. 2 was far more scenic and substantially tougher than
Cannonball, taking 4 hours longer to complete.  Also, about this time
a 750 mile event called Paris Brest Paris (PBP) was getting a lot of press,
mostly due to its recent Centennial event.  PBP draws 3,000 + riders
from around the globe with the next edition in ’95 and qualifying starting
in ’94.  Seattle International Randonneurs (SIR) was born and long
term, long distance friendships were formed.  I wouldn’t say the journey
has been easy but certainly not as difficult as imagined.  Through
randonneuring and PBP I’ve made friends from Australia and New Zealand
to Scandinavia and look back with pride and forward to sharing this marvelous
enduring experience with all who accept the challenge.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>CLASSIC CYCLE RACES OF EUROPE</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>23 race routes to ride your self.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Author: Rudolf Geser</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Available on Amazon.com</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Here is a superb book to tease and torment your mind. 
We have all dreamed of riding the classic cycling race routes in Europe
and this book will suck you into planning one or more Walter Mitty adventures. 
The routes, the same ones the pros race, are ridden as citizen races or
tours.  For each route all the information you need to participate
in an organized event or plan your own itinerary is listed.  This
includes: best date to ride, distance, total elevation gain, highest climb,
recommended gearing, start location, accommodations, start time, entry
fee, feed stations, approximate number of participants, contact address,
miscellaneous information, a graph showing the distance on the x axis and
elevation on the y axis (most routes look like the bottom jaw of a approaching
great white shark), a general map of the area with route hi-lighted, and
multi-page narrative description with photographs of what to expect while
riding.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The routes are categorized into 3 groupings.  The
first is 7 early season single day "Classics" including legends like Lieg-Bastogne-Liege,
Paris-Roubaix, Fleche Wallonne, and Milan-San Remo.  Next up are 5
alpine multi-stage "Europa Cup Marathons" in Austria,  Germany and
Italy.  Lastly  is "Other" with 11 routes like the International
Tour of Santis, Nine Hills Apennine, La Fausto Coppi-Cuneo and Alpine Tourest
Trial to mention a few.  Even if you mistakenly resist the desire
to go and ride one or more of these routes the reading and  dream
induced state are out of category. </FONT>

22, 1998</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Location: Teo’s</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Attendance: 22</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Presiding: Larry Ricker, Regional Brevet Administrator</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Minutes taken by: Kendall</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Meeting formally started at 7:45 and immediately focused
on the ‘98 brevets.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Brevet report:</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>200 km – Ellen "Max" Maxon,  Plans to a similar route
as last year.  This route starts near Snohomish, goes up to Arlington,
back to Sultan, Duvall, Stillwater, back up West Snoqualmie Valley road,
Highbridge and back to Snohomish.  Possible minor changes to the route
sheet requested are making the Cherry Valley turn clearer by noting as
the second Cherry Valley Road, and that the turn is "in Duvall" which climbs
a short 50 foot hill past school.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>300 km – Ken Carter,  Plans same route as last year
around Hood canal.  No changes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>400 km – Don Harkleroad.  Start at Monroe park by river. 
US2 Stevens Pass, Blewet Pass, Snoq. Pass, back up W Snoq. Valley Rd. 
and back to Monroe.  TerryZ offered to use his house as starting point. 
Terry lives a few miles from intersection of Woodinville-Duvall road /
W. Snoq. Valley Road.  There was much concern about getting riders
back down I-90 in daylight.  The start was moved to Monroe to help
get people further on course before dark.  This year we will have
more daylight hours, start closer to US2, and possibly start earlier. 
Don will look at timing of starting at TerryZ’s house.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Don H. will also run a 400 km ride on 6/13 starting from
East Wenatchee.  There will be no pre-ride of this one.  Larry
to check on viability of making this an official SIR brevet.  Route
similar to 1996 400 km.  John W. noted that the IR organization prefers
we sanction only the official rides submitted in October.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>600 km TerryZ – Terry offered same course as last year or
Mt Rainier or Olympic Peninsula.  No comments from members. 
Terry suggests standard route (same as last year) with start at his house
with shuttle up to Monroe for official start, but finish at Terry’s house
where people can shower.  Start up US2 and back via Highway 20. 
That direction seems safest.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Fleche NW – </B>no teams yet, need 3 by March 15 to
stage this event.  Wenatchee will be the banquet location.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>No response from Portland Randonneurs about using Centralia
as a finish point.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>There are people who want to ride the Fleche NW, but
not people to lead a team.  Ken Carter volunteered to captain a team.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>John W. will keep a list of people who are interested
in riding.  Kendall has routes from previous years in Excel spreadsheet
format.  TerryZ volunteers to captain a team but would prefer to ride
on Ken’s team.  Wayne Methner (a new member) volunteers as a team
caption.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Bill Dussler treasury report:</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>$100 donation was made to LAB.  Newsletter and previous
GM meeting refreshment expenses paid.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Membership applications available at the meeting. 
(Many people turned in applications at the meeting.)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>SIR Charter. – </B>Larry explained we need the charter
to be a viable club.  The SIR charter is modeled after another bike
club.  Comments welcome.  Larry highlighted some possibly contentious
issues.  All members are individual (no family memberships) 
January due date for membership.  No refunds.  Join in November
and you pay for the whole year anyway.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Executive board (EB) with 5 people to do the routine things,
but membership approves major items.  Members of the EB are appointed
by the director.</FONT>

law.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We will use LAB insurance again since it worked well last

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Minor wording problem with Charter noted by Max Maxon.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Treasurer notes that there will be no taxes that are applicable. 
Line in Charter pertaining to treasurer responsible for paying taxes to
be deleted since we have no taxes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Vote on charter as stands with 2 amendments approved by
all members present.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Medallions for ’97 brevets -</B> were mailed directly
to individuals without knowledge of Larry and this caused some confusion.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>International Randonneurs (IR) not responding to SIR inquires. 
Suggest writing letter expressing concerns of the club.  TerryZ suggests
working with other clubs instead of writing our own letter.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bypassing Konski is suggested but would require SIR contact
to be fluent French.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Larry experiences no return for email or letter.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Larry will circulate letter to club members before sending.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Will email letter to other regional brevet directors.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>New members are interested in a seminar on riding a Brevet
with info on Lights, shoes, and philosophy.  Don volunteered to lead
this.  Will put on at Teo’s or in conjunction with Bike Expo in February.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>RCC and SIR will combine at a booth for bike expo.  
John will provide a stand with Randonneuring/SIR handouts.  There
will be several people who are both SIR and RCC members at the booth.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Brevet cards for ‘97 were handed out.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>New business?   Aero bars? A joke!!! No rule
changes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>SIR Jersey discussion - </B>Ken Carter volunteers to
lead this effort but will need some help.  Ken will find out costs
and details.  Everyone seemed to like the previous SIR jersey and
many seemed to believe a new copy of it (sans PBP 95 logo) would be easy
and really nice.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>by John Wagner</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the things I noticed at the finish line of PBP
was a number of riders with sore necks and shoulders and numbness of hands
and feet.  Riding with this kind of discomfort has to impair your
decision making, your safety and in general your attitude will suffer. 
At least two such participants have since purchased new bikes with a shorter
top tube, for a more upright and balanced riding position.  Before
setting off on a long distance adventure make sure you are riding a proper
sized bike that it is set up to fit you and set up for comfort.  The
book Road Racing by Bernard HINAULT has an indispensable section on this
subject</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>What works for me:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>I use a Carbon Fiber frame, it doesn't rust and Girvin
suspension stem to absorb much of the road shock especially when riding
on that infernal chipseal for hours on end.  Carbon Fiber has a unique
ability to dampen vibration, the Girvin is for insurance.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>But let's start at the ground. The single most important
component on your bicycle is the wheels.  A set of high quality hand
built wheels with premium tires is the most cost effective investment in
comfort and reliability you can make. Spoke tension is the key and is an
art that machine built or a builder lacking experience can’t  duplicate. 
Spring for a good set and you'll never regret it.  I've heard that
Titanium spokes offer even more comfort but the price is prohibitive. 
I like 23 - 25 c Continental tires inflated with 100 lbs.  More tire
pressure only reduces comfort not rolling resistance.  Conti's offer
a ride close to tubulars and wear like iron.  Keviar belted tires
give a noticeably harsher ride and if you pay attention to where you point
your bike and the road surface, their alleged protection from flatting
is of little benefit.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Balanced weight distribution of gear and your body is
critical.  A stem set too low and your neck and shoulders suffer.
Too much weight up high on the rear rack and handling can get dangerous. 
I use a handle bar bag not only because it dispenses goodies conveniently
but it helps the balance.  I cant my seat a few degrees to the right
of center because my buttocks is not symmetrical.  I used to get saddle
sores and my shorts would wear thin always on the left side before this
adjustment.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Pilots pre-flight check an airplane before heading into
the blue yonder because they can't afford mechanical problems.  Start
doing the same to your bike before each ride. Keep your bike clean and
check for initial signs of cracking at stress points, there have been an
alarming number of near frame failures due to internal rust recently and
more to come with the advent of oversized thin wall tubing.  Pay attention
to the little things like your shoe cleats being tight or a loose head
set.  Bounce the bike and listen for strange sounds.  Investigate
creaks and rattles, they may be the portent of impending doom if left alone. 
Wiggle the wheels checking for properly adjusted bearings and making sure
your skewers are tight.  I heard that Eddy MERCKX carried an extra
seat binder bolt, it could literally save your buns. Paying attention is
merely a habit to develop and could make the difference between having
a great ride or getting stranded in some hell hole or worse, Montana.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Update - After PBP ’95 I sustained about 3 months of genital
numbness.  As a preventive measure I now ride a Softride beam bike
(prostate saver) and have ridden the Rocky Mountain 1200 and Scandinavian
1200 on it with only minor discomfort.</FONT>
