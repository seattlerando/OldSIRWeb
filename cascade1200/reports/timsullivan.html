<H1>Cascade 1200 Report</H1><br>

The Cascade 1200 was an awesome event - very challenging. I am waiting to see 
what the consensus is for the amount of the total elevation gain. My 
computer reset at the start of the third day so I will rely on Mark's 
estimate of over 40,000 feet of climbing.
</p>

<p align="left">
But first, Mark, Terry Zmrhal and Paul Johnson and all the SIR 
volunteers should be proud of this very well supported ride. It is a 
very challenging course made even more so since there were great 
distances without any services or towns. So having water stops 
supported by Mark's wife and children in the sparse Rattlesnake Hills 
during the hottest part of the second day was a welcomed sight.

Similarly on the last day another aid station was set up on the 
descent of Rainy Pass (appropriately named) when we riders were wet 
and cold. Being served hot cocoa at that moment was terrific.
</p>

At the start I felt out of place since my bike seemed to be one of the 
few without fenders. When I saw a rider with a Cervelo R2.5 (a great 
climbing machine that is on sale at Sammamish Valley Bicycles) with 
fenders I was shocked. But then it did rain on us several times during 
the ride.
</p>

The first day the course was terrific. Especially the road through the 
US forest Service land. Beautiful forests with good pavement and 
minimal car traffic. Also two serious climbs, especially the first one 
that went 12-13 miles if my memory serves me well. It was worth it on 
the downhill with clear views of Mt. St. Helens.
</p>

<p align="left">
The second day found us starting along the Columbia River and then 
following another river upstream until we climbed onto a plateau that 
had views of Mt. Adams and Mt. Hood. That afternoon found us in a more 
desolate area then fighting some fun cross-winds.
</p>

<p align="left">
The third day also had us in remote areas, including the metropolis of 
Farmer that consists of an old town hall with SIR volunteers serving 
food and directing the riders to use the facilities outside, a genuine 
outhouse. Once we hit the Columbia River again the scenery got better, 
although the only disappointment Kevin Main and I experienced was not 
being able to get apple pie at the Sweet River Bakery at Pateros, WA. 
In the middle of apple country one would expect a nice fresh apple 
pie. Instead I had to settle for an apple turnover. That day ended 
with a long climb up Loop Loop Pass followed by a wet downhill into a 
pretty valley with lots of deer wondering what we were doing.
</p>

The fourth day started with the best breakfast i have ever had while 
riding, a full buffet with pancakes, eggs, potatoes, meats, oatmeal, 
juice and coffee. This was after we had 7 hours of sleep in one night, 
more sleep that I have had total in either PBP or BMB. The great food 
helped with the climbing to Washington Pass at 5477 feet, the highest 
point of the ride. After the wet descent the rest of the afternoon 
stayed dry and we were able to comfortably finish the ride, alas 
without finding any apple pie again.
</p>

We were fortunate with the weather. If it had been what I remember 
normal weather for Eastern Washington it would have been a more 
difficult ride. I think that the highest temperature on Sunday was 
only around 85 degrees. Monday was much cooler.
</p>

<p align="left">
On the last day Kevin Main and I (Kevin rode with Linda Valadez, my 
riding companion and I for the last 2 1/2 days) discussed what is the 
most difficult 1200 KM. We agreed that the Cascade 1200 was the most 
challenging. With that said there were at least 2 things that made it 
different for me. One was the fact that everyone except for Ken Bonner 
was staying in the same place every night. That changes your mind set, 
you just need to get to the overnight control. An example of this 
happened to us after only 8 miles on the first day, Linda had a flat. 
Now our first response as we watched everyone else go by us, is that 
we were now in last place. I know there is no last place in randonneuring, but the competitive natures in Linda and me have not yet accepted that fact. But then we realized that it did not matter since everyone was going to be staying at the same place that night and we would start the next day the same as the 
other riders. We were able to continue in a relaxed matter.
</p>

<p align="left">
The second thing that made the ride different, was that it was a loop 
course with a lot of open spaces rather than an out and back such as 
BMB. At BMB I can mentally get through the course by getting from town 
to town in between the controls. For me that makes the ride go faster. 
That was not an option at the Cascade. Oftentimes there were not towns 
between the controls. For me that made it more difficult.
</p>

Once again Mark, Terry and everyone else at SIR should be proud of 
this ride. I hope that they decide to do it again.
