<b>Fee Structure Explanation for joining SIR:</b>                                               
<p>
You don't have to be a SIR member to paticipate, but we encourage you to join us! The costs are only $8.00 to join SIR with email-notice-only of events member, or $15.00 to join SIR as a regular, U.S. mail-notice-of-events member.  Also, all SIR members must join Randonneurs USA (RUSA) to ride. RUSA cost is $20.00 annually.
<p>
Equipment needed: Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">SIR Brevet Riders Expectations</a>.
<p>
Brevet participants should be aware of the inherent risks of long-distance cycling and must understand that they have responsibility for their own safety. Riding day and night in all kinds of weather on roads shared with cars and trucks can be dangerous. Riders are responsible to ensure that they are qualified, in good health, and in proper physical condition to participate in the brevets. Each rider is responsible for ensuring that his or her bicycle and other equipment are safe and appropriate for the brevets. Each rider is responsible for making his or her own decisions to stay safe at all times
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are a must or you'll face the scorn and abuse of your fellow randonneurs. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>
Helmets are required on all SIR events.</p>
<p>
Riders should be prepared to ride the last 110 km from Longmire back to Enumclaw without services.  This will be late at night or early in the morning when most stores and service stations will be closed.  More current information on available services will be available on this page 1 - 2 weeks before the brevet.
<p>
There will be a couple of rooms available at Kings Motel at the finish.  Riders are encouraged to stay and rest before heading for home.
<p>
<b>Bag Drop:</b> There will be no bag drop service.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b><br>
New for 2003, we'll trace part of the 200K route to Eatonville, continuing east to Elbe, then south on SR 7 to Morton.  We follow US 12 East to Randle, before starting an out-and-back leg (towards Windy Ridge) to Bear Meadow.  Back at Randle, we continue on US 12 East to Packwood, where we'll find Skate Creek Rd to take us to SR 706 near the Mt Rainier Park entrance.  Here there is another out-and-back leg, this time up to Longmire.  Finally we'll head for home through Elbe, Eatonville and South Prarie back to Enumclaw.
