<b>Special Instruction:</b><br>
This brevet will include an unusual "neutral" roll-out. At least 30 minutes will be allotted for riders to reach the official start location at Clarke Road and US-97 where the brevet will officially commence, promptly, at 5:30 AM. However, check-in will be conducted at the Ellensburg Super-8 between 4:15 and 4:45 AM. It is expected that most riders will ride together from the check-in to the start between 5:00 and 5:30 AM. It is not mandatory for riders to ride from the check-in to the official start, however, there is no parking available in the vicinity of the start location and no check-in will be conducted at the start location. Please refer to the tentative cue sheet for details.
<p>
Please be prepared for morning and overnight low temperatures in the low to mid-30s (0 C) and daytime highs reaching the low 80s (25 C).
<p>
Equipment Needed - Remember riding gear for inclement weather just in case, bike tools and spare tubes, and food/water for yourself.   Please see the "<a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">Expectations</a>" section of the SIR web site from whence the following has been excerpted:  For the 400 km, the following equipment is REQUIRED:                                          
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required.  Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors.  These may be checked and riders may be disqualified if they do not function.  Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times.  Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group.  Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother some other riders.                                            
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required.  This is for your safety and the safety of others in the group.                                          
<p>
Multiple redundant headlights, taillights, extra bulbs, and extra batteries are STRONGLY recommended, and may be required by the brevet leader.  Hand held flashlights are recommended for repairs made in the dark.                                          
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are STRONGLY recommended.  Additional rear splashguards (or "courtesy flaps") are recommended for group riding. Note: Fenders are never required, only recommended.
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> A backwards preview of some of the less familiar sections of the Cascade 1000/1200 route: We'll head NW from Ellensburg to cross Blewett Pass, descend to Hwy 2 and continue on through Wenatchee. We will cross to the east side of the Columbia River, east to Quincy and south to George. Then it will be south through Beverly and back down the gorge,  to Mattawa. A trip through the Rattlesnake Hills badlands via Hwy 24 and 241 will bring us to the backdoor of Washington's wine country. From Sunnyside it's back north and west again along the eastern slopes of the Yakima valley through the Selah Gap to Canyon Road for the return to Ellensburg.
<p>
<b>End of the ride:</b>  Ellensburg, WA
