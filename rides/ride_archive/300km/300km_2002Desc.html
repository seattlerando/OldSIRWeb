Ferry schedule and information: <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=sea-bi">http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=sea-bi</a>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Free on street parking is available south of the ferry terminal on Alaska Way, or about a mile north of the ferry terminal on Elliott Ave., just north of Pier 70 (N bound lane, at the Airborne Express HQ building.) Or, ride your bike to the ferry.
<p>
<b> Equipment needed:</b> Remember riding gear for inclement weather, bike tools, spare tubes, and food/water for yourself. All riders should be familiar with the SIR Brevet Riders Expectations - see <a href="../../../member/SIR_rider_expectations.html">http://www.seattlerandonneur.org/member/SIR_rider_expectations.html </a>
<p>
Headlights (white and clearly visible from 150 yards to oncoming traffic), tail lights, and red rear reflectors are required. Note that many taillights are also legal reflectors. These may be checked and riders disqualified if they do not function. Functional lights must be mounted on bike at all times. Lights must be operating at night on each bike in a group. Blinking taillights are permitted, but note that these may bother other riders. 
<p>
Reflective vests and leg bands are required for riding at night or during poor visibility. This is for your safety and others in the group. 
<p>
Hand held flashlights or helmet mounted lights are recommended for repairs made in the dark. 
<p>
As a courtesy to other riders, fenders (with 1/4 coverage front wheel and 1/2 coverage rear wheel) are recommended. Additional rear splashguards are recommended for group riding.
<p>

<b>Route Description:</b> We'll have lots of views of the Sound as we head due North from the Bainbridge Ferry Terminal to Agate Pass, Poulsbo and the Hood Canal bridge. Right after the bridge,
head north to Pt. Hadlock before turning south towards Quilcene and US 101. Just south of Hoodsport turn east onto SR106 to go around The Great Bend to Union and Belfair, on the Kitsap peninsula. There is a total of 9000 ft of climbing on this brevet. The first part of the ride has many rollers, but after Belfair the climbing picks up a notch as we tackle the many short climbs on the Kitsap and follow rough, quiet back roads to Holly and finally to Seabeck along the waters edge of the canal. The climbing continues out of Seabeck until we jump onto SR3 and cruise on the gentle rollers past Bangor back through Poulsbo and Bainbridge Island.
