<p>
It is not necessary to finish your fl&#xE8;che route at Fort Worden State Park. You may finish your route nearby and come to Fort Worden State Park for the
banquet. <I>Special Note:</I> three team members must attend the banquet.</p>
<p>
<b>Background:</b> The premise of the fl&#xE8;che, as devised by the French, is that on Easter weekend the randonneuring clubs from around the country ride in teams from their respective towns to a common destination (in southern France) for a banquet. The rules are minimal: each team comprises of 3 to 5  bicycles, they must cover a minimum of 360 km in exactly 24 hours, they must have on course controls to insure integrity of the route and travel unsupported (except at designated controls) on a unique route from the other teams. Rumors are the word "Fl&#xE8;che" translates as "arrows to a target" or "spokes of a hub." The destination is usually a resort community providing a festive surrounding for waiting family and friends. Completing a Fl&#xE8;che is also required for attaining a Randonneur 5000 standing with Audax Club Parisien.</p>
