<p>
<b>Special Instructions:</b> This is the first official distance 
brevet of the year so please be prepared.  Fenders are a <b>must</b> or you'll
face the scorn and abuse of your fellow Randonneurs!  This is a good time to try
out lights, bags, racks, food, etc.  Most people can finish this distance before
nightfall, but <b><i>if you are at all worried about finishing in the dark BRING
A LIGHT!</b></i>
<p>
<b>Route Description:</b> The new favorite route of 2000 makes its
return again in 2001.  With minor improvements (i.e. no Soos Creek Trail) the route 
is the same as last year.  Start the morning with a brisk jaunt to Black Diamond
and its famous bakery.  From the bakery, the ride travels out to Hobart and then 
to Ennumclaw.  From Ennumclaw the ride makes a new twist all the way out to the 
Mud Mt. road and follows the white river to 410.  After turning onto 410 the route 
follows the RAMROD course to Eatonville. We turn around in Eatonville and retrace our steps to Enumclaw.  A beautiful route along the west edge of town will eventually drop you into the Green River Valley. As every cyclist knows, what goes down must go up... You will certainly enjoy the 
climb out of the valley!  A <i> fast </i> finish will bring you back good and 
hungry and ready for the traditional end of the 200 km party.
<p>
<b>End of the ride:</b> Please join us (spouses welcome) for an
end of the ride party.  We will have home made chili, snacks, refreshments, etc.
If you want to clean up after the ride, please bring your own towel.
