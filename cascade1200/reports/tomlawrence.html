<H1>Cascade 1200k: the short version</H1><br>
By Tom Lawrence

My little camera died the day before the ride so I have no photos.
Sorry!

The short story is that I finished, and met my pre-ride goal of doing
the entire 1200k in daylight. I'm glad that I didn't ride any nighttime
hours because the scenery was just incredible. I've never been anywhere
where there is such variety of terrain in such a small area. Everything
from lush green forest with ferns and flowers along the roads to
death-valley style desert with not so much as a joshua tree, just sand
and tumbleweed, to huge rocky outcroppings like you would see in a
western movie, with ranches down below, to giant snow-capped peaks with
snow melt rushing down steep ravines. My favorite lasting memory of this
ride, I think, will be the overpowering scent of Balsam Fir on
Washington Pass.

I'm still in one piece and didn't really suffer any physical problems to
speak of, largely due to sleeping 6 to 8 hours every night. I think this
was probably harder than the 508, but less damaging because of the rest
opportunities. I'm really not at all beat up. Hands and butt are fine.
Mentally I had a rough time of it, often spending an hour or two just
looking at the road in front of me wondering why I was out there. But
the real heros are the ones who are really bad off physically and still
plug away. I saw Bernie several times during the ride and he always
looked close to death. But he finished. He said "you gotta just keep
showing up" and he did.

Conversation around the breakfast table on day 4 rated this ride
anywhere from "harder" to "much harder" than PBP. It was sort of a
"1200k meets Terrible Two" style ride. The climbing seemed to get harder
and steeper as the days wore on, but that might just have been my legs
getting more tired.

Ride organizer TerryZ expects to send out a CD with a compilation of the
best photos. I'll try to share some of them if/when this occurs.

Ok, back to the real world!
